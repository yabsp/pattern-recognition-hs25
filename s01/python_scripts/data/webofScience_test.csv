508,CS , Computer vision  , Surface roughness; Color distribution statistical matrix; Overlap degree of color; Robustness to the light source; Texture direction        ,"A ground surface roughness measurement method is proposed to address current problems in the use of machine vision technology to measure roughness: the calculations are complex, and the measurement process is largely affected by the light source. Based on the area of diffusion regions between the virtual images formed by a light source on ground surfaces with different roughness levels are different, a reference light source containing two base color is designed. Red and green color space-based color distribution statistical matrices, as well as corresponding overlap indices, are proposed. A relationship model between overlap index and roughness is constructed. The effect of light source brightness and texture direction on the relationship model is discussed based on the experimental data. The results demonstrate that the surface roughness measurement method, which is based on the overlap degree of the color image, has relatively high accuracy and a relatively wide measurement range and is, to a certain degree, robust to the brightness of the light source and the texture direction. The surface roughness measurement method has huge potential for engineering applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
712,CS , Computer vision  , Smartphone; Fat determination; Cold meat products; Soxhlet extraction; Image treatment analysis        ,"A method has been developed to determine the fat content in different cold meat products by image processing using the camera of a mobile phone. Salchichon, chorizo, salami and cured ham pictures were taken with a Meizu M2 Mini mobile phone camera under fixed lighting conditions of the light emitting diode flash of the mobile phone. Images were treated with Matlab to obtain the mean pixels of average red, green and blue camera values colours (RGB) of the pixels and different data pretreatments were taken into account to correlate colour parameters with fat content values determined in a series of commercially available samples by the Soxhlet method. RGB values were used as input variable and its correlation with fat content of samples was studied using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The best correlation between fat content and RGB colour descriptors was found in salchichon and salami samples using SVM, with relative errors of calibration, cross-validation and prediction of 18%, 20% and 16%, respectively. So, the use of a Smartphone camera provides an easy, low-cost, eco-friendly and rapid method for fat content determination in cold meat products. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
737,CS , Computer vision  , Microscope vision system; Micro laser line scanning; Adaptive genetic algorithms        ,"A microscope vision system to retrieve small metallic surface via micro laser line scanning and genetic algorithms is presented. In this technique, a 36 pm laser line is projected on the metallic surface through a laser diode head, which is placed to a small distance away from the target. The micro laser line is captured by a CCD camera, which is attached to the microscope. The surface topography is computed by triangulation by means of the line position and microscope vision parameters. The calibration of the microscope vision system is carried out by an adaptive genetic algorithm based on the line position. In this algorithm, an objective function is constructed from the microscope geometry to determine the microscope vision parameters. Also, the genetic algorithm provides the search space to calculate the microscope vision parameters with high accuracy in fast form. This procedure avoids errors produced by the missing of references and physical measurements, which are employed by the traditional microscope vision systems. The contribution of the proposed system is corroborated by an evaluation via accuracy and speed of the traditional microscope vision systems, which retrieve micro-scale surface topography."
862,CS , Computer vision  , Plant phenotyping tool; Computer vision; Yield prediction; Berries' segmentation; Smart devices; Vitis vinifera L        ,"A new image analysis algorithm based on mathematical morphology and pixel classification for grapevine berry counting is presented in this paper. First, a set of berry candidates represented by connected components was extracted. Then, six descriptors were calculated using key features of these components, and were employed for false positive (FP) discrimination using a supervised approach. More specifically, the set of descriptors modelled the grapes' distinctive shape, light reflection pattern and colour. Two classifiers were tested, a three-layer neural network and an optimised support vector machine. A dataset of 152 images was acquired with a low-cost smart phone camera. Images came from seven grapevine varieties, 18 per variety, at the two phenological stages in the Baggiolini scale between berry set (named stage K; 94 images) and cluster-closure (named stage L; 32 images). 126 of these images were kept for external validation and the remaining 26 were used for training (12 at stage L and 14 at K). From these training images, 5438 true/false positive samples were generated and labelled in terms of the six descriptors. The neural network performed better than the support vector machine, yielding consistent Recall and Precision average values of 0.9572 and 0.8705, respectively. The presented algorithm, implemented as a smartphone application, can constitute a useful diagnosis tool for the in-the-field and non-destructive yield prediction and berry set assessing for the grape and wine industry.

494,CS , Machine learning  , Color space; machine learning; skin detection; stacked autoencoders        ,"A good skin detector that is capable of capturing skin tones under different conditions is important for human-machine interaction applications. In a general situation, skin detectors, such as skin probability maps or Gaussian mixture models, achieve acceptable skin segmentation results. However, the false positive rate increases significantly when the skin tones are in shadow or when skin-like background objects are under similar illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel skin feature learning algorithm based on stacked autoencoders, which are deep neural networks. To overcome the problems encountered in skin segmentation that are caused by different ethnicities and varying illumination conditions, the stacked autoencoders are utilized to learn more discriminative representations of the skin area in both the RGB color space and the HSV color space. Unlike traditional machine learning methods, instead of predicting each pixel individually, our algorithm utilizes blocks to learn the representations and detect the skin areas. The algorithm exploits the learning ability of deep neural networks to learn high-level representations of skin tones. Experiments on test images show that the proposed algorithm achieves acceptable results on several publicly available data sets. To reduce the difficulty of detecting skin pixels in these data sets, the ground truths of these data sets are commonly focused on foreground skin area detection. Our skin detector is also able to detect background areas, as shown in our experiments."
536,CS , Machine learning  , Signal decomposition; Signal recovery; Sparse set of sinusoids; Time series modeling; Predictive least squares        ,"A heuristic procedure based on novel recursive formulation of sinusoid (RFS) and on regression with predictive least-squares (LS) enables to decompose both uniformly and nonuniformly sampled 1-d signals into a sparse set of sinusoids (SSS). An optimal SSS is found by Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization of RFS parameters of near-optimal sinusoids combined with common criteria for the estimation of the number of sinusoids embedded in noise. The procedure estimates both the cardinality and the parameters of SSS. The proposed algorithm enables to identify the RFS parameters of a sinusoid from a data sequence containing only a fraction of its cycle. In extreme cases when the frequency of a sinusoid approaches zero the algorithm is able to detect a linear trend in data. Also, an irregular sampling pattern enables the algorithm to correctly reconstruct the under-sampled sinusoid. Parsimonious nature of the obtaining models opens the possibilities of using the proposed method in machine learning and in expert and intelligent systems needing analysis and simple representation of 1-d signals. The properties of the proposed algorithm are evaluated on examples of irregularly sampled artificial signals in noise and are compared with high accuracy frequency estimation algorithms based on linear prediction (LP) approach, particularly with respect to Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB).

539,CS , Machine learning  , Fine particulate matter; Human exposure; Spatial nonstationarity; Geographically weighted; Machine learning        ,"A high degree of uncertainty associated with the emission inventory for China tends to degrade the performance of chemical transport models in predicting PM2.5 concentrations especially on a daily basis. In this study a novel machine learning algorithm, Geographically -Weighted Gradient Boosting Machine (GW-GBM), was developed by improving GBM through building spatial smoothing kernels to weigh the loss function. This modification addressed the spatial nonstationarity of the relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and predictor variables such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological conditions. GW-GBM also overcame the estimation bias of PM2.5 concentrations due to missing AOD retrievals, and thus potentially improved subsequent exposure analyses. GW-GBM showed good performance in predicting daily PM2.5 concentrations (R-2 = 0.76, RMSE = 23.0 g/m(3)) even with partially missing AOD data, which was better than the original GBM model (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 25.3 g/m(3)). On the basis of the continuous spatiotemporal prediction of PM2.5 concentrations, it was predicted that 95% of the population lived in areas where the estimated annual mean PM2.5 concentration was higher than 35 g/m(3), and 45% of the population was exposed to PM2.5 >75 g/m(3) for over 100 days in 2014. GW-GBM accurately predicted continuous daily PM2.5 concentrations in China for assessing acute human health effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
558,CS , Machine learning  , Drought forecasting; Machine learning; Climate forecast data; Remote sensing; Spatial interpolation        ,"A high-resolution drought forecast model for ungauged areas was developed in this study. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month time scales were forecasted with 1-6-month lead times at 0.05 x 0.05 degrees resolution. The use of long-range climate forecast data was compared to the use of climatological data for periods with no observation data. Machine learning models utilizing drought-related variables based on remote sensing data were compared to the spatial interpolation of Kriging. Two performance measures were used; one is producer's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in extreme, severe, and moderate drought classes over the total number of samples in those classes, and the other is user's drought accuracy, defined as the number of correctly classified samples in drought classes over the total number of samples classified to those classes. One of the machine learning models, extremely randomized trees, performed the best in most cases in terms of producer's accuracy reaching up to 64%, while spatial interpolation performed better in terms of user's accuracy up to 44%. The contribution of long-range climate forecast data was not significant under the conditions used in this study, but further improvement is expected if forecast skill is improved or a more sophisticated downscaling method is used. Simulated decreases of forecast error in precipitation and mean temperature were tested: the simulated decrease of forecast error in precipitation improves drought forecast while the decrease of forecast error in mean temperature does not contribute much. Although there is still some room for improvement, the developed model can be used for drought-related decision making in ungauged areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
633,CS , Machine learning  , Multiple linear regression; Error analysis; Predictive methods; Construction; Stepwise regression        ,"A literature review has identified the absence of a robust framework that guides the development of streamlined and valid multiple linear regression (MLR) predictive models for construction engineering applications. A reliable MLR model requires an appropriate set of input variables that can satisfy the underlying assumptions of best linear unbiased estimators (BLUE). In this research, an analytical framework is proposed for developing MLR-based predictive models by (1) selecting input variables based on a modified stepwise approach, (2) verifying the BLUE assumptions, and (3) validating the prediction performance of the regression model. The resulting MLR model only contains the most-relevant input variables while also fulfilling the BLUE assumptions. By utilizing statistical inference techniques, the MLR model also produces reliable range estimates around its point-value prediction according to a particular confidence level. To illustrate the application procedure of the proposed framework, a data set intended for workability control of ready-mixed concrete from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository is used. A practical case study based on a real-world bridge construction project is provided to further demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology in modeling the precast span installation cycle-time.

In order to establish credit profiles, there is a need to get information (e.g. spending patterns) from the consumers and from the companies that are selling related goods. The problem is how to share private information about customers and companies without compromising the secrecy and confidentiality of such information. In this work, we propose a cryptographic protocol to share sensitive information while preserving the privacy of the customer as well as the information of the commercial institution. Furthermore, we analyse the proposed protocol by using Petri nets to verify the absence of livelocks, deadlocks, and other anomalies in the protocol."

A safe data transmission requires integrity, availability and privacy protection features as well as efficient communication in diverse settings. Recently proposed security protocols for vehicular communication cannot authenticate in a complex way in areas of heavy traffic due to the increasing number of messages in proportion to the number of vehicles. For efficient communication, data volume need be reduced and communication should be safe against a range of attacks. Hence, the present paper proposes a protocol that accelerates message processing by sending a low data volume for communication in areas of heavy traffic and that blocks replay attacks by checking timestamps. In addition, CASPER/FDR (Lowe in Casper: a compiler for the analysis of security protocols. User Manual and Tutorial, Version 1.12, 2009; Formal Systems (Europe) Ltd in Failures-Divergence Renement.

Detecting such attacks based on traditional anomaly detection techniques may yield high false alarm rates. In this paper, we frame our problem as detecting slow-paced persistent attacks from a time series obtained from network trace. We focus on time series spectrum analysis to identify peculiar spectral patterns that may represent the occurrence of a persistent activity in the time domain. We propose a method to adaptively detect slow-paced persistent attacks in a time series and evaluate the proposed method by conducting experiments using both synthesized traffic and real-world traffic. The results show that the proposed method is capable of detecting slow-paced persistent attacks even in a noisy environment mixed with legitimate traffic."

Our method presents eight rounds; each round contains two transformations: row left shifting and columnwise rotation. The vectors for the transformations are different from one round to another, and they are controlled by two keys to the logistic map. These two keys are optimized by using TLBO which aims to construct a strong S-box that satisfies to the criteria set in advance. Test for the following criteria such as bijectivity, nonlinearity, strict avalanche criteria, equiprobable inputs/outputs XOR distribution is analyzed. Additionally, we will provide many comparisons with other S-boxes and test of the sensitivity to keys. The results of performance test show that the proposed design S-boxes presents good cryptography proprieties and can resist to several attacks."
898,CS , Cryptography  , Quantum dialogue protocol; Two-mode squeezed vacuum state; Quantum cryptography        ,"A new quantum dialogue protocol is designed by using the continuous-variable two-mode squeezed vacuum states due to its entanglement property. The two communication parties encode their own secret information into the entangled optical modes with the translation operations. Each communication party could deduce the secret information of their counterparts with the help of his or her secret information and the Bell-basis measurement results. The security of the proposed quantum dialogue protocol is guaranteed by the correlation between two-mode squeezed vacuum states and the decoy states performed with translation operations in randomly selected time slots. Compared with the discrete variable quantum dialogue protocols, the proposed continuous-variable quantum dialogue protocol is easy to realize with perfect utilization of quantum bits."
904,CS , Cryptography  , Cryptography; chaos; phase modulation; communication system security        ,"A new secure key distribution scheme based on the dynamic chaos synchronization of two cascaded semiconductor laser systems (CSLSs) subject to common chaotic injection and random phase-modulated optical feedback is demonstrated. In this scheme, Alice and Bob adopt two independent random sequences to control the phase modulators of CSLSs, which induces a dynamic perturbation to the chaos synchronization. We thoroughly investigate the chaos synchronization performance under different phase-shift conditions with cross-correlation function, and systematically discuss the feasibility and security of the system. The results show that, with proper injection and feedback strength, the correlation coefficient gap between phase shift match and mismatch is clear and robust to the parameter mismatches in the CSLSs and those between the two CSLSs. Based on this, high-quality key distribution can be performed by picking out the identical random bits from the two independent random sequences according to the computational correlation. Moreover, the investigations on the information theoretic security and rate of the key distribution show that the security of the key distribution scheme can be further enhanced by properly increasing the number of layers in the CSLSs or employing highorder modulation format."
962,CS , Cryptography  , Asymmetric quantum dialogue; Noise models; Secure quantum communication        ,"A notion of asymmetric quantum dialogue (AQD) is introduced. Conventional protocols of quantum dialogue are essentially symmetric as the users (Alice and Bob) can encode the same amount of classical information. In contrast, the proposed scheme for AQD provides different amount of communication powers to Alice and Bob. The proposed scheme offers an architecture, where the entangled state to be used and the encoding scheme to be shared between Alice and Bob depend on the amount of classical information they want to exchange with each other. The general structure for the AQD scheme has been obtained using a group theoretic structure of the operators introduced in Shukla et al. (Phys Lett A 377: 518, 2013). The effect of different types of noises (e.g., amplitude damping and phase damping noise) on the proposed scheme is investigated, and it is shown that the proposed scheme for AQD is robust and it uses an optimized amount of quantum resources."

This implementation provides a detailed analysis based on a number of factors with respect to the security considerations of the protocol, particularly in its design stage. Thus, it provides a broad verification as well as step-by-step evaluation of the protocol specifications from its implementation point of view."

One such vulnerability is return-oriented programming attack. An return-oriented programming attack circumvents the dynamic execution prevention, which is employed in modern operating systems to prevent execution of data segments, and attempts to execute unintended instructions by overwriting the stack exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability. Numerous defense mechanisms have been proposed in the past few years to mitigate/prevent the attack - compile time methods that add checking logic to the program code before compilation, dynamic methods that monitor the control-flow integrity during execution and randomization methods that aim at randomizing instruction locations. This paper discusses (i) these different static, dynamic, and randomization techniques proposed recently and (ii) compares the techniques based on their effectiveness and performances.

Such is the case in the industrial sector where the automation process relieved partly or wholly the human activities needed in the manufacturing process. This is mainly due to time sharing in embedded real-time systems and to pseudo-parallel execution of tasks in the implementation of a single central processing unit. The present article presents the validation of the nHSE (Hardware Scheduler Engine) scheduler implemented in hardware by using a FPGA Xilinx Virtex-7, Vivado development platform, and the Vivado Simulator. In this context, our main contribution relates to a custom interrupt management scheduling policy implemented in hardware at the nHSE level, in order to provide predictable execution for asynchronous interrupts. By reducing the jitter when handling with asynchronous interrupts and completely eliminating the uncertainties of the scheduling limit for the set of tasks, a significant improvement of the overall system's predictability has been obtained."
1341,CS , Operating systems  , Mobile applications; Software product-line engineering; Feature model        ,"A significant challenge faced by the mobile application industry is developing and maintaining multiple native variants of mobile applications to support different mobile operating systems, devices and varying application functional requirements. The current industrial practice is to develop and maintain these variants separately. Any potential change has to be applied across variants manually, which is neither efficient nor scalable. We consider the problem of supporting multiple platforms as a 'software product-line engineering' problem. The paper proposes a novel application of product-line model-driven engineering to mobile application development and addresses the key challenges of feature-based native mobile application variants for multiple platforms. Specifically, we deal with three types of variations in mobile applications: variation due to operation systems and their versions, software and hardware capabilities of mobile devices, and functionalities offered by the mobile application. We develop a tool MOPPET that automates the proposed approach. Finally, the results of applying the approach on two industrial case studies show that the proposed approach is applicable to industrial mobile applications and have potential to significantly reduce the development effort and time.

Many 3D segmentation techniques are available in the literature, how to efficiently evaluate these methods is an important issue. In this paper we propose a new objective evaluation metric suitable for the evaluation of 3D segmentation methods, based on the Dice Coefficient (DC). Dice Coefficient is a similarity coefficient, designed to compute the degree of similarity between sample data sets. We extend this approach to mesh segmentation evaluation, since the regions of a segmented mesh can be seen as sample data sets. Many of the existing metrics does not take into consideration the irregularity of the 3D meshes, our proposal integrate the surface of faces in the adaptation of the Dice Coefficient to evaluate the segmentation of both regular and irregular meshes.

However, most of the presently available methods are slow and inefficient because of sequential design however the recent development in the field of programmable logic devices such as FPLA and CPLD opens the new area of parallel and high speed floating point designs. Considering that the synchronous architectures requires that that all clock events happen at the same time over the complete circuit which it not possible due to clock skew also the latency and throughput of the circuit are directly linked to the worst-case delay of the slowest element which increases the delay. Hence this paper presents self-timed carry look ahead adder based implementation of IEEE 754 32 bit floating point multiplier for FPGA devices. The simulation results shows that the proposed design has lower latency than synchronous design as well as lower power requirements."

In this study, 14 parameters were extracted: area, eccentricity, perimeter, length/ area, blue value, green value, red value, width, contrast, texture, width/ area, width/ length, roughness, and length. Further, the ANFIS (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System) method was utilized to estimate the orange mass from the data obtained using the image processing in three varieties. In ANFIS model, samples were divided into two sets, one with 70% for training set and the other one with 30% for testing set. The results of the present study demonstrated that the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the best model for Bam, Khooni and Thompson measured 0.948, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively.

Legible droplet images were acquired with a single-lens reflex camera, a micro-distance lens and illumination source in the proper parameters. The droplets were extracted effectively based on the background subtraction, region-growing repair, shape-factor screening and concave points matching methods. The droplet characterizations, including projective area, diameter and volume were calculated using MATLAB image processing technology. The system displayed droplet sizes and distribution regulation in graphs that were convenient for obtaining experimental regulation. Indoor comparison experiments between the developed system and oil disk method was conducted, and the average relative errors were 6.03%, 5.50% and 6.25% for D-V (0.1), D-V 0.5, D-V 0.9, respectively. Field comparison experiments revealed that the relative error was 5.61% between the developed system and the oil disk method and 6.88% between the developed system and the laser instrument method. Application experiments in the field were conducted and the result revealed that fine droplets had better penetration than coarse droplets in the tree canopy. The system was simple in structure, had a lower cost compared with some instruments and reduced experimental time compared with the image processing methods that use oil disks.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important greenhouse gas affected by human activity. About half of the CO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion remains in the atmosphere, contributing to rising temperatures, while the other half is absorbed by natural land and ocean carbon reservoirs. Despite the importance of CO2, many questions remain regarding the processes that control these fluxes and how they may change in response to a changing climate. This visualization shows how column CO2 mixing ratios are strongly affected by local emissions and large-scale weather systems. In order to fully understand carbon flux processes, observations and atmospheric models must work closely together to determine when and where observed CO2 came from. Together, the combination of high-resolution data and models will guide climate models towards more reliable predictions of future conditions. Published by Elsevier B.V."

The types of database used in remote sites can be divided into two categories: Relational Databases (RDB) and NoSQL. NoSQL databases store data in a flexible format, and without schema, so NoSQL databases can be easily scaled across multiple devices. Because of the advantages of the NoSQL databases, many large data applications use NoSQL databases as the backend data management system. Because NoSQL databases usually access the stored data as files, through a distributed file system, the problem of decentralized data management is critical in NoSQL databases. In order to address this issue, many energy-efficient algorithms for file placement are used in distributed file systems. However, these energy-efficient algorithms only focus on reducing the power consumption of storage systems and they ignore the cost of data reliability, which is affected by frequently setting the disk status to standby mode. To maintain data reliability, energy-efficient storage systems usually combine framework of power conservation and a fault tolerance mechanism. However, most developers of energy-efficient frameworks do not consider whether the fault tolerance mechanism can avoid data loss when this combination is used for energy-efficient storage systems. This study proposes a general energy-efficient framework that can be integrated different fault tolerance mechanisms. The experimental results show that the capability of the proposed framework with different erasure code algorithms."
960,CS , Relational databases  , NoSQL Injection; Security Analysis; Defense; Detection Level        ,"A NoSQL, also called a ""Non-Relational"" or ""Not only SQL,"" database system provides an approach to data management and database design for very large sets of distributed data and real-time web applications. A NoSQL database system is also a popular data storage for information retrieval because it supports better scalability, availability, and faster data access while comparing with traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). What the RDBMS data needs is predictable as its data is stored in structured tables by defining the relationship between the different columns. In contrary the data in NoSQL databases does not need to be stored in a structured or fixed fashion. When performance and realtime access are more concerned than consistency, such as indexing and retrieving large numbers of records, NoSQL databases are more suitable than relational databases. With their obvious advantages in better performance, scalability, and flexibility, NoSQL databases have been adopted lately by many small businesses as they are moving their increasing business data into the clouds. However, the research on the security of a specific NoSQL database system or NoSQL database systems in general is very limited. Although there are many storage advantages in NoSQL databases, the need of quick and easy access to data has been seriously affected by the security issue of NoSQL databases. This paper examines the maturity of security measures for MongoDB, a typical NoSQL database system, with aspects in both attack and defense at the code level. The experimental testing on NoSQL injections is performed with JavaScript and PHP. After the demonstration on how a server-side JavaScript injection attack against a NoSQL database system reveals the customer's private data, two methods are discussed in preventing this type of security problems from happening. It is believed that our study will help database developers not only realizing that NoSQL database systems are not designed with security as a priority but also learning how to build a security layer to their organizations' NoSQL applications to avoid NoSQL injections."

As a possible alternative, state-of-the-art NoSQL data stores that sacrifice transactional consistency to achieve higher performance and scalability can be utilized. In this paper, we describe the challenges in large scale persisting and analysis of numerical streaming logs. We propose to develop a benchmark comparing relational databases with state-of-the-art NoSQL data stores to persist and analyze numerical logs.

Efficient updating information in probabilistic databases is required in several applications, such as sensor networking and data cleaning. As a way to update a probabilistic database, conditioning refines the probability distribution of the possible worlds based on general knowledge, such as functional dependencies. The existing methods for conditioning are exponential over the number of variables in the probabilistic database for an arbitrary constraint. In this paper, a constraint-based conditioning framework is proposed, which solves the conditioning problem by considering only the variables in the given constraint. Then, we prove the correctness of our proposed approach and provide efficient algorithms for each step of the approach. Afterward, a pruning strategy that can significantly improve the efficiency of the constraint-based approach is proposed for the functional dependency constraints. Furthermore, for functional dependency constraints, a variable-elimination strategy that minimizes the number of generated variables can benefit the subsequent query processing. The experimental study shows that the constraint based approach is more efficient than other approaches described in the literature. The effectiveness of the two optimization strategies for functional dependency constraints is also demonstrated in the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Software defect prediction comprises two major procedures: (i) Design of appropriate software metrics to represent characteristic software system properties; and (ii) development of effective regression models for count data, allowing for accurate prediction of the number of software defects. Although significant research effort has been devoted to software metrics design, research in count data regression has been rather limited. More specifically, most used methods have not been explicitly designed to tackle the problem of metrics driven software defect counts prediction, thus postulating irrelevant assumptions, such as (log-)linearity of the modeled data. In addition, a lack of simple and efficient algorithms for posterior computation has made more elaborate hierarchical Bayesian approaches appear unattractive in the context of software defect prediction. To address these issues, in this paper we introduce a doubly stochastic Poisson process for count data regression, the failure log-rate of which is driven by a novel latent space stochastic feed forward neural network. Our approach yields simple and efficient updates for its complicated conditional distributions by means of sampling importance resampling and error backpropagation.

To avoid undesirable noise from high-level linguistic tools, the process is mainly composed of positive and negative base filters that are less error prone and more robust. The extracted candidates are then reordered using a weight propagation algorithm based on structural hints from source documents. When tested on French text corpora from public organizations, our process performs 2.7 times better than a statistical baseline for relevant concept discovery.

In particular, the key capabilities of Cloud-RAN in computing-resource sharing and real-time communication among the VBSs are leveraged to design a joint dynamic radio clustering and cooperative beamforming scheme that maximizes the downlink Weighted Sum-Rate System Utility (WSRSU). Due to the combinatorial nature of the radio clustering process and to the non-convexity of the cooperative beamforming design, the underlying optimization problem is NP-hard, and is extremely difficult to solve for a large network. The proposed approach aims for a suboptimal solution by transforming the original problem into a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Program (MI-SOCP) and applying Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) to derive a novel iterative algorithm. Numerical simulation results show that our low-complexity algorithm provides near-optimal performance in terms of WSRSU while significantly outperforming conventional radio clustering and beamforming schemes.

1510,CS , Distributed computing  , Gathering; Deterministic algorithm; Anonymous mobile agent        ,"A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to meet at the same node. Agents are anonymous (identical), execute the same deterministic algorithm and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. An initial configuration of agents is called gatherable if there exists a deterministic algorithm (even dedicated to this particular configuration) that achieves meeting of all agents in one node. Which configurations are gatherable and how to gather all of them deterministically by the same algorithm? We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks. We characterize all gatherable configurations and give two universal deterministic gathering algorithms, i.e., algorithms that gather all gatherable configurations. The first algorithm works under the assumption that a common upper bound on the size of the network is known to all agents. In this case our algorithm guarantees gathering with detection, i.e., the existence of a round for any gatherable configuration, such that all agents are at the same node and all declare that gathering is accomplished. If no upper bound on the size of the network is known, we show that a universal algorithm for gathering with detection does not exist. Hence, for this harder scenario, we construct a second universal gathering algorithm, which guarantees that, for any gatherable configuration, all agents eventually get to one node and stop, although they cannot tell if gathering is over. The time of the first algorithm is polynomial in the upper bound on the size of the network, and the time of the second algorithm is polynomial in the (unknown) size itself. Our results have an important consequence for the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs. Leader election is a fundamental symmetry breaking problem in distributed computing. Its goal is to assign, in some common round, value 1 (leader) to one of the entities and value 0 (non-leader) to all others. For anonymous agents in graphs, leader election turns out to be equivalent to gathering with detection. Hence, as a by-product, we obtain a complete solution of the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs."

More specifically, STW-KNN considers the spatial-temporal correlation and weight of traffic flow with trend adjustment features, to optimize the search mechanisms containing state vector, proximity measure, prediction function, and K selection. Furthermore, STW-KNN is implemented on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform with the MapReduce parallel processing paradigm, for parallel prediction of traffic flow in real time.

The contact discretization is based on the well-known mortar finite element method using dual Lagrange multipliers to facilitate the handling of the additional Lagrange multiplier degrees of freedom. Exploiting the similarity of the typical inequality constraints of plasticity and friction, all involved discrete inequalities are reformulated as nonlinear non-smooth equations using complementarity functions. The resulting set of discrete semi-smooth equations can be solved efficiently by a variant of Newton's method, where all additionally introduced variables are condensed from the global system so that a linear system only consisting of the displacement degrees of freedom has to be solved in each iteration step. In contrast to classical radial return mapping methods for computational plasticity, the plastic constraints are not required to hold at every iterate in the nonlinear solution procedure, but only at convergence. This relaxation in the pre-asymptotic behavior results in an increased flexibility regarding algorithm design and a potentially higher robustness compared to radial return mapping algorithms. The presented elasto-plasticity algorithm includes arbitrary isotropic hyperelasticity, an anisotropic Hill-type yield function with isotropic and kinematic hardening, plastic spin and appropriate finite element technology for nearly incompressible materials.

From data pretreatment, to algorithm design, to association rule mining and pattern visualization, this paper outlines a spatiotemporal mining framework for abnormal association patterns in marine environments, including pixel-based and object-based mining models. Within this framework, some key issues are also addressed. In the data pretreatment phase, we propose an algorithm for extracting abnormal objects or pixels over marine surfaces, and construct a mining transaction table with object-based and pixel-based strategies. In the mining algorithm phase, a recursion method to construct a direct association pattern tree is addressed with an asymmetric mutual information table, and a recursive mining algorithm to find frequent items. In the knowledge visualization phase, a ""Dimension-Attributes"" visualization framework is used to display spatiotemporal association patterns. Finally, spatiotemporal association patterns for marine environmental parameters in the Pacific Ocean are identified, and the results prove the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed mining framework.

The algorithm is based on statistical inference and fuzzy logic to achieve fusion of measured data with the capability of adjusting the membership functions for different street lighting systems ( different number of lamps and power consumption). The system with the above mentioned faults was simulated with the Monte Carlo method before its implementation in two real street lighting systems.

This model which applies the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system is inclusive of empirical model for predicting the important parameters for engine cycles: the combustion timing and mass burnt fraction during the combustion process. The hypothesis is the increasing intake temperature can reduce the combustion duration and the fuel consumption at wide range of equivalence ratio. The intake temperature were increased from 373-433 K with increment of 20 K. The engine was operated over a range of equivalence ratios of 0.2 to 0.5 at constant engine speed of 1200 rpm and intake pressure of 89,950 k Pa. Simulations were performed using Simulink (R) under different engine operating conditions. Increasing intake temperature allows reducing the combustion duration by 0.99 degrees CA and 0.26 degrees CA at equivalence ratios of 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. The brake specific fuel consumption decreases about 6.09%-5.76% at 0.2-0.5 of equivalence ratios. Thus, fuel consumption can be reduced by increasing intake temperature."

KGLPP has the advantage of preserving global and local data structures simultaneously. The kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), which only preserves the global Euclidean structure of data, and the kernel locality preserving projections (KLPP), which only preserves the local neighborhood structure of data, are unified in the KGLPP framework. KPCA and KLPP can be easily derived from KGLPP by choosing some particular values of parameters. As a result, KGLPP is more powerful than KPCA and KLPP in capturing useful data characteristics. A KGLPP-based monitoring method is proposed for nonlinear processes. T-2 and SPE statistics are constructed in the feature space for fault detection.

NLLSPP can simultaneously preserve the nonlocal structure (i.e., data variance) and the local structure (i.e., neighborhood relationships between data points) of the data set. According to nonadjacent or neighboring relationships of different pairs of data points, NLLSPP defines nonlocal or local similarity weight coefficients for pairwise data points on the basis of their distances. The nonlocal similarity weight coefficients force two nonadjacent data points to be projected far apart from each other. The local similarity weight coefficients force two neighboring data points to be projected near each other. In this way, nonlocal and local structures of the data set are naturally preserved and highlighted in a lower-dimensional space. Because of this advantage, NLLSPP is more powerful than principal component analysis (PCA) and locality preserving projections (LPP) in extracting important data characteristics. A process monitoring method is developed based on the NLLSPP algorithm. Its advantages are illustrated by a case study on the Tennessee Eastman process. The results indicate that the NLLSPP-based method has better monitoring performance that the PCA-based and LPP-based methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

LOUDS is a succinct data structure with bit-string, and its space usage is extremely compact. However, its traversal speed is not so fast. This paper presents a new compression method of the double-array with keeping the retrieval speed. Our new method compresses the double-array by dividing the double-array into blocks and by using linear functions. Experimental results for varied keywords show that our new method reduced space usage of the double-array up to about 44 %, and the retrieval speed of the new method was 9-14 times faster than that of LOUDS.

ADTs allow more precise description of program types and more robust handling of data structures than are directly supported by C. ADT definitions and other declarations are put in a file that is preprocessed by adtpp to produce a C header (.h') file that can be included in C source files. The generated header file contains C type definitions, macros, and inline functions that support type-safe construction, deconstruction, and pattern matching of ADT values while avoiding unsafe operations such as casts, and avoiding the risk of errors such as dereferencing NULL pointers and accessing inappropriate fields of unions. Values are represented efficiently, using techniques from the implementation of declarative languages. For many simple data types, the memory representation is identical to a direct implementation in C, with no loss of efficiency. For more complex types, the adtpp representation is more efficient than common C representations while preserving type safety and convenience. As an example, we present a new variation of 234-trees that is very compact. Adtpp also supports parametric polymorphism such as defining a type list of t', where t can be any ADT, and generic functions such as length. However, polymorphic code is somewhat more verbose than for typical declarative languages, due to our reliance on the limited type checking available in C. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

However, little is known about the functions and mechanisms of lncRNAs and circRNAs in self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells. Therefore, we explored the expression profiles of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs in male and female mouse germline stem cells by high-throughput sequencing. We identified 18573 novel lncRNAs and 18822 circRNAs in the germline stem cells and further confirmed the existence of these lncRNAs and circRNAs by RT-PCR. The results showed that male and female germline stem cells had similar GDNF signaling mechanism. Subsequently, 8115 mRNAs, 3996 lncRNAs, and 921 circRNAs exhibited sex-biased expression that may be associated with germline stem cell acquisition of the sex-specific properties required for differentiation into gametes. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed different functions for these sex-biased lncRNAs and circRNAs. We further constructed correlated expression networks including coding-noncoding co-expression and competing endogenous RNAs with bioinformatics. Co-expression analysis showed hundreds of lncRNAs were correlated with sex differences in mouse germline stem cells, including lncRNA Gm11851, lncRNA Gm12840, lncRNA 4930405O22Rik, and lncRNA Atp10d.

TGF-beta signaling is a major inducer of EMT and can facilitate lung cancer metastasis. However, the role of lncRNAs in this process remains largely unknown. Here, we have identified 291 IncRNAs which were differentially expressed in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Of these, the gene body or vicinity of 19 transcripts were also bound by SMAD3. The expression of LINC01186 was significantly decreased in A549 cells treated with TGF-beta. Furthermore, LINC01186 was stably down-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared with normal tissues in TCGA data sets and another published lung cancer data sets. The bioinformatics analysis suggested that LINC01186 was associated with TGF-beta and might participate in EMT process. Moreover, knocking-down LINC01186 promoted cell migration and invasion, whereas, LINC01186 overexpression prevented cell metastasis. Importantly, LINC01186 expression was regulated by SMAD3. And LINC01186 affected several EMT markers expression.

CIRH1A was highly expressed in carcinoma samples and colorectal cancer cells. We also transduced the RKO colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line with lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and studied the impact that this knockdown of CIRH1A expression had on cell growth. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated inhibition of CIRH1A expression significantly suppressed proliferation and increased apoptosis of transduced cells, and tended to arrest them in G(1) phase. Our data suggest that CIRH1A plays a critical role in the proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis of human malignant colorectal cells, and might therefore be a potential target for therapeutic strategies."

In this study, we explored the functional involvement of long non-coding RNA (IncRNA) SNHG14 and its potential regulatory mechanism in the activation of MCs. The mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and microglia cell model of oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) were made. The expression of SNHG14, miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A protein expression was determined by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively. Dual-luciferase assay was used to verify the direct binding of miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A. Flow cytometry was applied to measure neurons' apoptosis. SNHG14 highly expressed in ischemic cerebral tissues and BV-2 cells after OGD treatment. SNHG14 knockdown could remarkably inhibit BV-2 cells activation induced by OGD; while SNHG14 overexpression significantly promoted BV-2 cells activation, showing an increase of TNF-alpha and NO production and neurons' apoptosis rate. Additionally, SNHG14 knockdown promoted the expression of miR-145-5p and reduced PLA2G4A. Contrarily, SNHG14 overexpression inhibited miR-145-5p expression and increased PLA2G4A. Moreover, miR-145-5p overexpression also reversed the effect of OGD on BV-2 cells activation. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assay supported that SNHG14 could bind directly to miR-145-5p and miR-145-5pbinding site was existed on 3'-UTR of PLA2G4A. MiR-1455p mimic reversed the increase of PLA2G4A and reduced the high levels of TNF-a and NO in BV-2 cells induced by SNHG14 overexpression. SNHG14 increased the expression of PLA2G4A by inhibition of miR-145-5p, which resulted in the activation of MCs in cerebral infarction. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The optimal parameters for the MFC were an anode density of 1.22 g cm(-3), a coke of 150 mu m: an anode length of 6 cm, a PVA of 105,600 g mol(-1), and a separator thickness of 1 cm. Results of continuous-flow experiments reveal that the increasing the sets of MFCs and connecting them in parallel markedly improved the degradation of benzene.

The HCB was degraded to pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB), and trichlorobenzene (TCB) in sequence by a reductive dechlorination process in soil MFCs. The influences of the external resistance, concentration of phosphate buffer, and electrode spacing in soil MFCs on the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were analyzed. The results showed that the degradation rate and removal efficiency of HCB were increased when the external resistance decreased from 2000 to 20 (1, and also when the concentration of phosphate buffer increased. The anode area played a significant role in dechlorination of HCB. Altering the spacing of the reducing electrode resulted in a lower ohmic resistance in the soil MFCs. The ohmic resistance was negatively correlated with the removal efficiency and degradation rate (P < 0.05). In conclusion, HCB removal efficiency could be enhanced by soil MFCs, the performance of which was improved by a decrease in external resistance and internal resistance, and an increase in phosphate buffer concentration, rather than just by shortening the electrode spacing."

In the literature, many detection schemes have been proposed to detect NTL frauds. However, some NTL frauds are far more complicated than what the existing schemes expect. We recently discovered a new potential type of frauds, a variant of NTL frauds, called Colluded Non-Technical Loss (CNTL) frauds in the Smart Grid. In a CNTL fraud, multiple fraudsters can co-exist or collaborate to commit the fraud. Existing detection schemes cannot detect CNTL frauds since these methods do not consider the co-existing or collaborating fraudsters, and therefore cannot distinguish one from many fraudsters. In this paper, we propose a CNTL fraud detector to detect CNTL frauds. The proposed method can quickly detect a tampered meter based on recursive least squares. After identifying the tampered meter, the proposed scheme can detect different fraudsters using mathematical models. Our experiments show that our method is effective in detecting CNTL frauds.

One of these has to do with the interplay between fields and potentials, with the latter often seen as just a convenient mathematical artifice useful in solving Maxwell's equations. Nonetheless, to those practiced in application it is well understood that various alternatives in the use of fields and potentials are available within electromagnetic (EM) theory for the definitions of energy density, momentum transfer, EM stress-energy tensor, and so forth. Although the various options are all compatible with the basic equations of electrodynamics (e.g., Maxwell's equations, Lorentz force law, gauge invariance), nonetheless certain alternative formulations lend themselves to being seen as preferable to others with regard to the transparency of their application to physical problems of interest. Here we argue for the transparency of an energy density/power flux option based on the EM potentials alone."

In this paper, a proposal to search for fractional charge particles is presented, which is based on the conservation law of four-momentum and the Lorentz force law. To show the power of the new strategy, a fully BESIII detector simulated signal sample mixed with a fully simulated background sample is analyzed and lower signal cross section limits to discover 5 sigma signal as a function of quark mass are estimated for the background. The analysis result shows that in comparison with ionization energy loss measurements, the advantage of the strategy is that it can identify fractional charge particles without using any theoretical or empirical formulae to calculate any expected observation values."

Recently, we have found memristors in the electrical circuitry of plants and seeds. There are no publications in literature about the possible existence of memristors and electrical differentiators in fruits. Here we found that the electrostimulation of Golden Delicious or Arkansas Black apple fruits by bipolar periodic waves induces hysteresis loops with pinched points in cyclic voltammograms at low frequencies between 0.1 MHz and 1 MHz. At high frequencies of 1 kHz, the pinched hysteresis loop transforms to a non-pinched hysteresis loop instead of a single line I= V / R for ideal memristors because the amplitude of electrical current depends on capacitance of a fruit's tissue and electrodes, frequency and direction of scanning. Electrostimulation of electrical circuits in apple fruits by periodic voltage waves also induces electrotonic potential propagation due to cell-to-cell electrical coupling with electrical differentiators. A differentiator is an electrical circuit in which the output of the circuit is approximately directly proportional to the rate of change of the input.

The power amplifier can provide various signals flexibly and realize rapid response of the magnetic suspension spindle in micro-electrical discharge machining (EDM). In this paper, the principle of three-level PWM amplifier with half bridge and full bridge power circuit is introduced. According to different functions, the amplifier is divided into four function modules which include PWM signal generator module, voltage signal convert module, bootstrap drive module, and power bridge module. PWM signal generator module is also divided into four sub-modules in term of a new FPGA algorithm. Voltage signals are converted by high-speed photo coupler HCPL-2630. IR2110S chips are applied to drive the half bridge and full bridge power circuits. According to Kirchhoff voltage law, when the period of PWM signals is 50 mu s and the duty cycles are larger than 0.76 and 0.665, the average current of half bridge and full bridge are more than 3 and 4 A; however, the ripple of the half bridge and full bridge are still less than 0.25 and 0.2 A, this advantage is suitable for the control system of magnetic suspension spindle. Test results of the average current and ripple are close to theoretical value. The axial response frequency of the spindle can reach 125 Hz, using this power amplifier and the magnetic suspension spindle, micro EDM can be achieved in Z axis with 1.2 mm stroke."

These appear to perform at least as well as an existing Clipped Voltage Law. Comparisons with available results from a robust reliability-based controller show OSOF control to be quite effective. Controlled response using OSOF is compared with Linear Quadratic Guassian (LQG) and passive-on controllers. Moderate to substantial reduction in maximum peak/RMS responses is mostly obtained with base configuration of sensors when using OSOF control, and controller CPU time reduces by two orders of magnitude. Parametric studies regarding sensor configuration and state/control weighting matrices are performed in order to obtain effective control.

Based on the conventional LQR method, the proposed controller is designed and makes the following two improvements. First, in order to eliminate the phase error caused by right-half-phase zero emerged in non-minimum phase boost converter, a feedforward controller is implemented by zero phase error tracking control technique because the inverse of non-minimum phase system is unstable. Second, since the models of DC-DC converter in CCM or DCM are different, the proposed control strategy allows boost converter to autonomously operate in CCM or DCM controller by utilising a mode detector. The proposed mode detector greatly enhances the control performance in both operating modes. Finally, the proposed controller has been implemented for voltage control of a boost converter. The simulation and experimental results show the proposed controller offers better performance in both transient response and frequency response than the conventional LQR controller."

In the framework of multiresolution analysis, the proposed projection operator wavelet kernel can fulfill the multiscale, multidimensional learning to estimate complex dependencies. The special advantage of the projection operator wavelet kernel developed in this paper lies in the fact that it has a closed-form expression, which greatly facilitates its application in kernel learning. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first closed-form orthogonal projection wavelet kernel reported in the literature.

Human behavior (e.g., smoking and exercise) and reactions to treatment are complex and depend on many unmeasurable external stimuli, some of which are unknown. Thus, it is crucial to model human behavior over many subject responses. We propose a simple (low order) uncertain affine model subject to uncertainties whose response covers the most probable behavioral responses. The proposed model contains two different types of uncertainties: uncertainty of the dynamics and external perturbations that patients face in their daily life. Once the uncertain model is defined, we demonstrate how least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) can be used as an identification tool. The lasso algorithm provides a way to directly estimate a model subject to sparse perturbations. With this estimated model, a robust control algorithm is developed, where one relies on the special structure of the uncertainty to develop efficient optimization algorithms. This paper concludes by using the proposed algorithm in a numerical experiment that simulates treatment for the urge to smoke."

The normalized form guarantees novelty and versatility of the investigation on one hand and independency in relation to the concrete inverter parameters like output power, supplying voltage and operating frequency on the other. From the whole power network of fourth order for the first time two sub circuits are suggested to be outlined: the output (load) sub circuit and the inverter commutating sub circuit. Both sub circuits of a second order define the parameters of the endmost inverter circuit again of the same order and consequently the mode of operation and parameters of the power inverter itself. The transformation is possible owing to the newly found fact that the frequency dependencies of the output (load) sub circuit can be separated from the dependencies that describe the structural relationships between the two sub circuits. The results from that conversion are of course more accurate when the resonant frequencies of the both sub circuits and the operating frequency do not differ substantially. The suggested approach is useful on order to obtain a simplified engineer method for precise and fast design of large class of static power converters applicable in electronic technology like induction heating and melting."

Numerical models for 3D quasi-steady state and transient simulations have been implemented and carried out by the Institute of Mechanics and Fluid Dynamics.

It may a useful alternative to an electric motor. The operations strategy of the H-SIT has to be investigated to achieve maximum utilization of its function. In this study, the master logic diagram (i.e., an analysis for identifying the differences between an H-SIT and a safety injection pump) and an accident case classification were used to determine the parameters of the H-SIT operation. The conditions that require the use of an H-SIT were determined using a decision-making process. The proper timing for using an H-SIT was also analyzed by using the Multi-dimensional Analysis of Reactor Safety (MARS) 1.3 code (Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea). The operation strategy analysis indicates that a H-SIT can mitigate five types of failure: (1) failure of the safety injection pump, (2) failure of the passive auxiliary feedwater system, (3) failure of the depressurization system, (4) failure of the shutdown cooling pump (SCP), and (5) failure of the recirculation system. The results of the MARS code demonstrate that the time allowed for recovery can be extended when using an H-SIT, compared with the same situation in which an H-SIT is not used. Based on the results, the use of an H-SIT is recommended, especially after the pilot-operated safety relief valve (POSRV) is opened.

632,ECE , Electric motor  , liquid metal; centrifugal rotational motion; liquid metal electric motor; soft machine; electrolyte solution; Lorentz force        ,"A liquid metal electric motor including a pair of concentric ring electrodes, permanent magnet and electrolyte solution is demonstrated. A liquid metal galinstan sphere, along with a NaOH solution, is stimulated to rotate centrifugally around the central electrode and the rotating speed increases with the voltage. The NaOH solution serves to rapidly remove the oxide on the liquid metal surface, reduce the motion friction and provide impetus to the liquid metal. As the mass of the liquid metal is increased to 12.16 g to form a kidney-like body, its rotating speed appears more controllable and the effect of the electrolytic action in the NaOH solution becomes weak in the range of 0-1.82 V. As the mass of the liquid metal is increased to 18.20 g to form a circular ring-shaped body, the ideal voltage range for controlling the rotating motion of the liquid metal is 0-0.81 V. The metal fluid rotates at a speed of 1.9 r.p.m., even at an extremely low voltage of 0.03 V. The liquid metal electric motor established here can find important applications in chip cooling, liquid metal pumps, material mixing, soft machine realization, etc."

The paper proposes to determine a transmission gear ratio on the basis of the following: provision of wheel torque dependence on tractor speed which is the best one for a traction process and during transfer from one gear to the other; provision of nominal operational mode of the electric motor for all tractor operations where it is working for a long period of time; provision of minimum possible number of gears; complete realization of internal combustion engine power on the tractor wheels at limit operational mode of the electric motor. As a characteristic of the asynchronous electric motor with variable-frequency control contains various portions which can be used either completely or partially due to operating conditions, the gear number is determined in the process of transmission gear ration finding but not prior to this. A wheel torque of the tractor with electro-mechanical transmission can be limited according to the following factors: grip of wheel with supporting surface; maximum power of an internal combustion engine which can be transferred to the wheels and a torque which is developed by a propulsion electric motor. It is not proposed to exceed nominal operational mode of the propulsion electric motor for all the operations of the tractor if it is working for a long period of time because in the case of significant excess of the nominal operational mode of the asynchronous electric motor its rather long operation leads to low efficiency and high losses in power, large heat liberation and consequently requires to develop more complicated system for electric motor cooling. An excess of nominal electric motor torque can be justified for short-term operational modes because in this case there is no need to select more powerful electric motor and create an additional gear in the gear-box."

This model takes into account the coupled behavior between motor, pump and production system. Thus, given a defined frequency in the variable speed drive, the motor temperature was determined as a result of the equilibrium between the heat generation, calculated from the power that the pump demands from the motor, and the heat extraction resistance, calculated from the production flow rate around the motor. Furthermore, in real field operations, the measurement of the motor temperature is made at the lower end of the stator winding, which is not exactly the maximum temperature point. In order to predict the maximum motor temperature value, the model developed in this work determines the motor temperature distribution. A convective heat transfer study has also been made comparing models based on fully developed temperature profile to models that consider the development of the thermal boundary layer. A case study has been made with several oil viscosities and water cut. The results showed a fact commonly observed in ESP field operations, that is, the motor temperature rises when the motor speed is continuously increased. It was also shown that neglecting the effect of the thermal boundary layer development may result in an overheated motor prediction where actually, the motor maximum temperature is much lower than its upper limit. Thus, it was observed that fully developed temperature profile models suffer from inaccuracy when used in viscous oil applications, because of their great thermal entry length. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Radio spikes have time scales of 20-200 ms, while hard X-ray bursts rarely show fine structures shorter than 1 s. The main conclusions of a statistical analysis of a) the association rate, b) the correlation degree, and c) relative time delays between hard X-ray and radio spike emissions, are: 1) Radio spike bursts reveal the highest hard X-ray association rate of any kind of coherent solar radio emission; approximately 95% of the observed events occur during (mostly impulsive) hard X-ray bursts. Conversely, almost-equal-to 2% of all HXRBS flares produce radio millisecond spike bursts. 2) Spike bursts are preferentially associated with the impulsive phase of the hard X-ray event; about half of all observations are closely associated with the main peak of a simultaneous X-ray event. 3) We find a significant temporal correlation between spike clusters and hard X-ray events. About 43% of the compared events show hard X-ray time profiles that mimic the concentration of simultaneous radio spikes. This also holds for small fluctuations with time scales of the order of a few seconds. 4) The durations of spike events and associated hard X-ray bursts closely correlate, the X-ray bursts being somewhat longer than the radio events. 5) The radio emission is usually delayed in respect to hard X-ray bursts, typically a few seconds. The relative delays seem to be restricted to the following rules: The radio event usually starts before the peak time of the hard X-ray event (73 out of 84 cases), and similarly, the X-ray burst almost always starts before the maximum of spike burst activity (83 out of 84 cases). This is shown to hold for a wide range of burst durations. We have not found any convincing relation concerning the relative time differences of the end times, however. 6) The observed delays of the order of several seconds put some constraints on the acceleration and propagation of particles. The delays are found to be incompatible with the build-up time of a loss-cone distribution (for maser emission) by an order of magnitude, if the, same population of electrons is responsible for radio and X-ray radiation. Rather, considering the smallness of the radio spike sources, the proportionality of the X-ray flux with the spike rate, and the spatial 'spread of a propagating electron population, it is argued that both the time delays and the quantization into discrete radio events are caused by the operation of the accelerator."

Designing a safe, reliable and robust controller with good performance for such a large and complex system is an important control engineering problem. In this work, a Decentralized Fuzzy Logic Controller (DFLC) with 140 input and 70 output membership functions, is designed for a 70th order Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) type PHWR. In order to obtain high performance of the controller, it needs to be tuned optimally, however, it is very challenging task to optimally tune the DFLC with such a large membership functions. Moreover, PHWR is a coupled system which imposes additional limitation in tuning the controller since the output of one PHWR's zone affects the outputs of other zones. In this work, an application of Nelder-Mead Algorithm (NMA) is presented for auto tuning the DFLC. The NMA performance depends upon objective function and initial points given to the NMA at the start of the tuning process. A novel method for selecting the optimal objective function and initial points for the NMA is also proposed since their selection is another complicated process. Although several objective functions have been proposed by the researchers for use with NMA, this work focuses five common indices (IAE, ISE, ITAE, ITSE and ISTE) as objective functions, which are simple and system independent. Finally, the optimally tuned high-performance DFLC is applied to the PHWR and evaluated by simulating different scenarios. The simulation results show that the controller is efficient, fast and robust and ensures the safety and reliability of the PHWR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Several stability conditions for loops with slope restricted nonlinearities were developed. Results such as the Circle Criterion and the Popov Criterion form part of the core curriculum for students of control. Moreover, the equivalence of results obtained by different techniques, specifically Lyapunov and Popov's stability theories, led to one of the most important results in control engineering: the KYP Lemma. For Luryel systems this work culminated in the class of multipliers proposed by O'Shea in 1966 and formalized by Zames and Falb in 1968. The superiority of this class was quickly and widely accepted. Nevertheless the result was ahead of its time as graphical techniques were preferred in the absence of readily available computer optimization. Its first systematic use as a stability criterion came 20 years after the initial proposal of the class. A further 20 years have been required to develop a proper understanding of the different techniques that can be used. In this long gestation some significant knowledge has been overlooked or forgotten. Most significantly, O'Shea's contribution and insight is no longer acknowledged; his papers are barely cited despite his original parameterization of the class. This tutorial paper aims to provide a clear and comprehensive introduction to the topic from a user's viewpoint. We review the main results: the stability theory, the properties of the multipliers (including their phase properties, phase-equivalence results and the issues associated with causality), and convex searches. For clarity of exposition we restrict our attention to continuous time multipliers for single-input single-output results. Nevertheless we include several recent significant developments by the authors and others. We illustrate all these topics using an example proposed by O'Shea himself.

This subcircuit may be acting as a sample-and-hold (S/H), as a passive mixer (P-M), or as a bandpass filter or bandpass impedance. In this work, we will present a useful analysis that leads to a simple signal flow graph (SFG), which captures the FET-R-C circuit's action completely across a wide range of design parameters. The SFG dissects the circuit into three filtering functions and ideal sampling. This greatly simplifies analysis of frequency response, noise, input impedance, and conversion gain, and leads to guidelines for optimum design. The analysis is extended to multi- path realizations common in RF applications. Part I of this paper focuses on the analyses of a single-path FET-R-C circuit's signal transfer characteristics.

The binary output reports the occurrence of a certain state (versus any other state) in the Markov chain. The transition matrix of the Markov chain depends on a control vector which is to be chosen to minimize a discounted infinite-horizon cost function. The information provided for decision making is the entire history of the binary output which presents an incomplete knowledge of the Markov chain and, as a consequence, leads to a stochastic control problem with partial observations. The solution to such a problem is a control policy consisting of two components: an estimator to derive the posterior probability distribution of the Markov chain from the observation set, and a nonlinear control law to map this estimate into the control vector. This paper introduces a nonlinear state-space representation for the estimator, develops analytical expressions for the control law, and presents numerical methods for efficient computation of the optimal control. Application of these results to optimal management of a class of inventory systems is discussed, and the performance of optimal control for this application is examined by numerical simulations."

The target is first in first out (FIFO) systems, in which the precedence relations are represented by a directed acyclic graph. Using max-plus algebra, a system's behavior can be described by a set of linear equations referred to as the state space representation. Using this representation, we address the problem of adjusting system parameters and determining optimal control inputs for given reference signals. To determine system parameters, we formulate and solve an optimization problem using a branch-and-bound method, by which the number of constraints is reduced. Then, the optimal control inputs are determined. Since this part is often the bottleneck in online control, we propose two methods for the efficient computation thereof. The first method is beneficial for systems with sparse adjacency matrices and small-scale systems with a greater prediction horizon. In contrast, the second approach is beneficial for larger-scale systems with a smaller prediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified through numerical simulations."

The proposed power system consists of a WTG, PV, aqua-electrolyzer (AE), fuel cell (FC), battery energy storage system (BESS), flywheel (FW) and diesel engine generator (DEG). Furthermore, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (EVs) are implemented at the customer side. A full-order observer is utilized to estimate the supply error. Then, the estimated supply error is considered in a frequency domain. The high-frequency component is reduced by BESS and FW; while the low-frequency component of supply error is mitigated using FC, EV and DEG. Two PI controllers are implemented in the proposed system to control the system frequency and reduce the supply error. The epsilon multi-objective genetic algorithm (epsilon-MOGA) is applied to optimize the controllers' parameters. The performance of the proposed control scheme is compared with that of recent well-established techniques, such as a PID controller tuned by the quasi-oppositional harmony search algorithm (QOHSA).

While traditionally only P or PI controllers have been employed, recent applications that require a fast transient performance impose the usage of the derivative, D, term. As it is well known, using the D-term can cause numerous problems in such converters that greatly downgrade their performance and lifetime. Having said that, in this paper, we first prove that by using the D-term, it is possible to increase the stability margin (and hence keep a low current ripple), and then, we present a novel method to tune the PID controller that guarantees a fast and stable response over a wide range of parameter values without using an unreasonably high value of the derivative gain that magnifies the presence of noise in the system. The controller is designed utilising Filippov's method, and a simple and easy to implement strategy is proposed. Furthermore, an adaptive PID controller is designed whose gains are changed depending on the value of the supply voltage or output load.

The ambient force and heat applied on the LGS crystal produces the shift in its resonant frequency. The proposed closed loop electronics tracks the shift in resonant frequency and measures the pressure and temperature by relating to the difference in frequency shift. The steady state oscillation condition of the resonator circuit is analytically derived and experimentally verified. The experimental setup consists of an operational amplifier based resonator circuit connected to the langasite piezo crystal placed between a double side diametric forces loading device with temperature controller bath. The diametric force applied on the LGS crystal produces the frequency shift in its fundamental mechanical vibration mode (Cmode). Similarly, the change in temperature produces the frequency shift in its second mechanical vibrational mode (Bmode). The frequency shifts are measured using two separate closed loop resonator electronics for two different measurand. Whenever the force on the LGS crystal is changed by the external unknown pressure, an additional intrinsic material property change is added to the piezo and changes the fundamental oscillating resonant frequency. The closed loop resonant circuit tracks the change in resonance frequency and vibrates the LGS with the new resonance frequency depends on the external pressure strength. Similar procedure is followed for temperature induce frequency tracking measurement also. The proposed frequency tracking electronics concept is simple and it is found that it has high sensitivity and linearity."

The model uses implicit algebraic differential equations compatible with transient analysis in SPICE. It also shares the accuracy level of the transient analysis. A micro model approach is used, and each trap is treated by a two-state Markov process. The normalization of trap behavior can be enabled or disabled, so that the designer can compare average trap behavior to the result of repeated Monte-Carlo simulations of a circuit. In this manner, the model can compromise between device-level modeling and circuit-level modeling. Unlike models geared towards digital circuit design, the trapping and release rates need not be constant during electrical stress. The trapping and release rates are a function of time, as they depend on the circuit state-space equations. An operational amplifier is analyzed using the new model, and the proposed approach is compared with the state of the art. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

On the contrary, initial recent evidence indicates that East Asian religiosity predicts tolerance of various outgroups-except atheists. To understand these differences, we investigated cognitive (intolerance of contradiction) and emotional (disgust) mechanisms possibly mediating the link between religiosity and prejudice versus tolerance. In Study 1 (295 Westerners of Christian tradition), high disgust contamination and, to some extent, intolerance of contradiction mediated the relationship between religiosity and prejudice against ethnic (Africans), religious (Muslims), moral (homosexuals), and convictional (atheists) outgroups. However, in Study 2 (196 Taiwanese of Buddhist or Taoist tradition), religiosity was unrelated to disgust, and predicted low intolerance of contradiction, and thus tolerance of the same religious, ethnic, and moral outgroups-but still not of atheists. Cultural differences in cognition and emotion seem to explain East-West differences in religious prejudice."

In archival studies of news articles written about Black and White celebrities in popular culture magazines (Study 1a) and American politicians (Study 1b), the more critical rather than complimentary the stories, the darker the skin tone of the photographs printed with the article. In the remaining four studies, participants associated immoral acts with darker skinned people when examining surveillance footage (Studies 2 and 4), and when matching headshots to good and bad actions (Studies 3 and 5). We additionally found that both race-based (Studies 2, 3, and 5) and shade-based (Studies 4 and 5) associations between badness and darkness determine whether people demonstrate the ""bad is black"" effect.

In Study 1, frequency of self-reported multicultural experiences was associated with greater openness and less ethnic prejudice, and openness explained the relationship between multicultural experiences and ethnic prejudice. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated a multicultural experience. Compared to those in a control condition, participants exposed to the cultural members and elements of foreign cultures reported being higher in Openness to Experience and expressed less prejudice toward these cultural groups. There was also some evidence that multicultural exposure, through openness, caused secondary transfer effects in prejudice reduction. Our findings suggest that exposure to multicultural environments can improve intercultural attitudes by personality shifts in Openness to Experience."
1988,Psychology  , Prejudice  , Perspective taking; Peer influence; Motor simulation; Action observation        ,"Adolescents are particularly prone to peer influence. Since group membership modulates the person's tendency to take someone else's viewpoint, here we decided to investigate whether adolescents are influenced by the presence of a peer when taking another person's perspective. A group of adolescents from upper secondary schools in Naples (Italy) had to observe scenes of an actor (an adolescent or an adult) gazing, grasping, gazing/grasping an object or staying still. When required to judge the spatial location of the object, the adolescent participants adopted the actor's viewpoint (third-person perspective) more frequently when the actor was an adolescent rather than when he was an adult and when the adolescent actor grasped the object. Thus, adolescents seem particularly prone to mentally simulate someone else's actions when the other person is a peer. These findings suggest that modulating motor simulation processes via social environmental factors could influence adolescents' perspective taking.

We assessed Jewish-Israeli and Arab-Palestinian adolescents for brain response to the pain of ingroup/outgroup protagonists using magnetoencephalography (MEG), one-on-one positive and conflictual interactions with an outgroup member, attitudes toward the regional conflict, and oxytocin levels. A neural marker of ingroup bias emerged, expressed via alpha modulations in the somatosensory cortex (S1) that characterized an automatic response to the pain of all protagonists followed by rebound/enhancement to ingroup pain only. Adolescents' hostile social interactions with outgroup members and uncompromising attitudes toward the conflict influenced this neural marker. Furthermore, higher oxytocin levels in the Jewish-Israeli majority and tighter brain-to-brain synchrony among group members in the Arab-Palestinian minority enhanced the neural ingroup bias. Findings suggest that in cases of intractable intergroup conflict, top-down control mechanisms may block the brain's evolutionary-ancient resonance to outgroup pain, pinpointing adolescents' interpersonal and sociocognitive processes as potential targets for intervention."

Researchers have found that low-income children score significantly lower than middle-income children on false belief understanding but have not examined why this difference exists. We hypothesized that children's language and parent discipline mediate the income-false belief relation. Participants were 174 3- to 6-year-olds. False belief understanding was significantly correlated with family income, children's vocabulary, parents' self reported discussion of children's behavior, discussion of emotions, and power assertion. Family income had a significant indirect effect on false belief understanding through children's vocabulary and parent discipline when examined independently, but only through children's vocabulary when using parallel multiple mediation.

The high survival rate of these patients into adulthood has exposed the alarming prevalence of long-term neuropsychological and psychiatric morbidities. Dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) is one of the most extensively studied cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD) with regard to neurodevelopmental outcomes. Landmark studies have described a common neurodevelopmental and behavioral phenotype associated with D-TGA. Children with D-TGA display impairments in key neurocognitive areas, including visual-spatial and fine motor abilities, executive functioning, processing speed, and social cognition. As they grow older, they may face additional challenges with a worsening of deficits in higher order cognitive skills, problems in psychosocial adjustment and a higher-than-expected rate of psychiatric disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety. The aim of this review is to summarize the available recent data on neuropsychological and psychiatric outcomes in individuals with D-TGA after the arterial switch operation. We present findings within a life-span perspective, with a particular emphasis on the emerging literature on adolescent and young adult outcomes. Finally, we propose avenues for future research in the CHD adult neuropsychology field. Among these avenues, we explore the potential mechanisms by which pediatric neurodevelopmental impairments may have lifelong adverse effects as well as alternative interventions that could optimize outcomes."

In this study, connectomics was used to assess the evolution of brain networks from infancy to early adolescence. Brain network reorganization over time in subjects who had suffered adverse perinatal conditions is characterized and related to neurodevelopment and cognition. Three cohorts of prematurely born infants and children (between 28 and 35 weeks of gestational age), including individuals with a birth weight appropriated for gestational age and with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), were evaluated at 1, 6, and 10 years of age, respectively. A common developmental trajectory of brain networks was identified in both control and IUGR groups: network efficiencies of the fractional anisotropy (FA)-weighted and normalized connectomes increase with age, which can be related to maturation and myelination of fiber connections while the number of connections decreases, which can be associated to an axonal pruning process and reorganization. Comparing subjects with or without IUGR, a similar pattern of network differences between groups was observed in the three developmental stages, mainly characterized by IUGR group having reduced brain network efficiencies in binary and FA-weighted connectomes and increased efficiencies in the connectome normalized by its total connection strength (FA). Associations between brain networks and neurobehavioral impairments were also evaluated showing a relationship between different network metrics and specific social cognition-related scores, as well as a higher risk of inattention/hyperactivity and/or executive functional disorders in IUGR children."

Previous studies examined affective ToM ability in patients with Huntingtons disease (HD), using the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes test"" (RMET). Results were consistent in showing difficulties in inferring complex mental states from photographs of people even in the early stage of HD. However, there has been no agreement as to whether or not cognitive impairments in HD population might have contributed to poor performance on the RMET test. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the affective ToM ability was impaired in the mild to moderate stages of HD, and whether there was an association between compromised ToM ability and the presence of cognitive impairment. We evaluated ToM by means of RMET and global cognitive functioning by means of the MoCA questionnaire in 15 HD patients and 15 healthy subjects (HS). Both groups were matched for age and level of education. Our study showed that the ability to judge a persons mental states from a picture of their eyes was impaired in HD patients compared to normal population. Indeed, HD subjects gave the 34% of correct responses on RMET, whereas healthy control subjects percentage of correct responses was 71%. Furthermore, this impairment was not correlated with global cognitive functioning except for the visuospatial task. These results show that RMET might represent a valid instrument to assess affective ToM ability in HD patients in the mild to moderate stages of the disease, independently from their cognitive status. Since it is known that HD patients, in addition to motor symptoms, suffer from cognitive deficits, including memory and executive impairments, it is important to have an instrument, which is not influenced by cognitive abilities. It is possible therefore to use RMET to assess important aspects of HD patients such as their ability to recognize others emotions and feelings even when patients suffer from cognitive decline."

Data from 170 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 98 healthy controls were used to examine relations between these demographic factors and performance across multiple domains and measures of social cognition. Sex was not related to performance on any domain, but older age was related to poorer emotion recognition from dynamic stimuli in both patients and controls. In patients, older age was also associated with better abilities to decipher hints. Both Caucasian patients and controls performed better than African American individuals on emotion recognition and mental state attribution tasks that use only Caucasian individuals as visual stimuli. Findings suggest rather limited influences of demographic factors but do demonstrate normative age and race effects among patients. Findings also highlight important methodological considerations for measurement of social cognition."
1521,Psychology  , Person perception  , social attribution; explanations; lay theories; causal inference; folk psychology        ,"A theoretical model is proposed that specifies lay causal theories of behavior; and supporting experimental evidence is presented. The model's basic assumption is that different types of behavior trigger different hypotheses concerning the types of causes that may have brought about the behavior. Seven categories are distinguished that are assumed to serve as both behavior types and explanation types: goals, dispositions, temporary states such as emotions, intentional actions, outcomes, events, and stimulus attributes. The model specifies inference rules that lay people use when explaining behavior (actions are caused by goals; goals are caused by higher order goals or temporary states; temporary states are caused by dispositions, stimulus attributes, or events; outcomes are caused by actions, temporary states, dispositions, stimulus attributes, or events; events are caused by dispositions or preceding events). Two experiments are reported. Experiment 1 showed that free-response explanations followed the assumed inference rules. Experiment 2 demonstrated that explanations which match the inference rules are generated faster and more frequently than non matching explanations. Together, the findings support models that incorporate knowledge based aspects into the process of causal explanation. The results are discussed with respect to their implications for different stages of this process, such as the activation of causal hypotheses and their subsequent selection, as well as with respect to social influences on this process."
1615,Psychology  , Person perception  , comparison; social information processing; event-related potentials; attractiveness; trustworthiness        ,"A wide array of social decisions relies on social comparisons. As such, these decisions require fast access to relative information. Therefore, we expect that signatures of the comparative process should be observable in electrophysiological components at an early stage of information processing. However, to date, little is known about the neural time course of social target comparisons. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis in 2 electroencephalography (EEG) studies using a social distance effect paradigm. The distance effect capitalizes on the fact that stimuli close on a certain dimension take longer to compare than stimuli clearly differing on this dimension. Here, we manipulated the distance of face characteristics regarding their levels of attractiveness (Study 1) and trustworthiness (Study 2), 2 essential social dimensions. In both studies, size comparisons served as a nonsocial control condition. In Study 1, distance related effects were apparent 170 ms (vertex positive potential, VPP) and 200 ms (N2) after stimulus onset for attractiveness comparisons. In Study 2, trustworthiness comparisons took effect already after 100 ms (N1) and likewise carried over to an event-related N2. Remarkably, we observed a similar temporal pattern for social (attractiveness, trustworthiness) and nonsocial (size) dimensions. These results speak in favor of an early encoding of comparative information and emphasize the primary role of comparison in social information processing."

We argue that judges' opinions emerge from their current concerns, be it to promote their own well-being, or to foster group cohesion. Targets of judgments can best interpret the meaning of a judgment they receive by understanding the judge's concerns, competence of the judge, and other qualities of the transaction. We suggest that judges and targets who are better able to reason about the judgment process are likely to change their behaviors more adaptively than people less able to reason in this area."

Politicians, for example, are thought to perform media relations activities because they ascribe great importance to the media. This has been tested regarding politicians' online activities using data from two surveys of members of Germany's national parliament, the Bundestag ( n(t1/t2) = 194/149). It was hypothesized that parliamentarians use Facebook and Twitter more extensively when they believe that these social media tools have a strong political influence on the public, journalists, and other politicians. However, the results indicate that parliamentarians use Facebook and Twitter regardless of whether they expect it to have an impact on other people. Therefore, politicians' online activities are determined by other reasons and not such strategic motives. Thus, although ( or precisely because) the hypotheses are rejected, the findings are an important contribution to the research on politicians' motives for online communication."

The use of follower reports of leader behavior creates challenges given that a large body of basic and applied research suggests that behavioral ratings reflect not only recall of actual behaviors, but also inferences based on semantic memory, which may vary among individuals. In this paper, we examine several explanations for rater effects that are associated with follower individual differences, contextual factors, and even research methods, such as the type of measure used, that may bias ratings of leader behavior. We also develop a conceptual model to illustrate these processes. Finally, we offer potential solutions to increase accuracy in follower reports of leader behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Results from studies using symptom rating scales suggest that these abnormalities are profound (i.e., 3-5 SDs) and occur across virtually every channel of vocal expression. Computerized acoustic analytic technologies, used to overcome practical and psychometric limitations with symptom rating scales, have found much more benign and isolated abnormalities. To better understand vocal deficits in schizophrenia and to advance acoustic analytic technologies for clinical and research applications, we examined archived speech samples from 5 separate studies, each using different speaking tasks (patient N = 309; control N = 117). We sought to: (a) use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify independent vocal expression measures from a large set of variables, (b) quantify how patients with schizophrenia are abnormal with respect to these variables, (c) evaluate the impact of demographic and contextual factors (e.g., study site, speaking task), and (d) examine the relationship between clinically-rated psychiatric symptoms and vocal variables. PCA identified 7 independent markers of vocal expression. Most of these vocal variables varied considerably as a function of context and many were associated with demographic factors. After controlling for context and demographics, there were no meaningful differences in vocal expression between patients and controls. Within patients, vocal variables were associated with a range of psychiatric symptoms-though only pause length was significantly associated with clinically rated negative symptoms. The discussion centers on explaining the apparent discordance between clinical and computerized speech measures."

Because the most recent meta-analyses were published in 2010 and reflected work through 2009, the task force conducted a search of the published studies from 2009-2013. These recently published articles were scored and assessed by a systematic evidentiary review, followed by a meta-analysis of the high utility studies, as documented in the evidentiary review. Consistent with the literature that we reviewed, we found that violent video game exposure was associated with: an increased composite aggression score; increased aggressive behavior; increased aggressive cognitions; increased aggressive affect, increased desensitization, and decreased empathy; and increased physiological arousal. The size of the effects was similar to that in prior meta-analyses, suggesting a stable result.

However, positive peer influence effects are not yet well understood. The present fMRI study tested a novel hypothesis, by examining neural correlates of prosocial peer influence on donation decisions in adolescence. Participants ( age 12-16 years; N - 61) made decisions in anonymous groups about the allocation of tokens between themselves and the group in a public goods game. Two spectator groups of same-age peers-in fact youth actors-were allegedly online during some of the decisions. The task had a within-subjects design with three conditions: ( 1) Evaluation: spectators evaluated decisions with likes for large donations to the group, ( 2) Spectator: spectators were present but no evaluative feedback was displayed and ( 3) Alone: no spectators nor feedback. Results showed that prosocial behavior increased in the presence of peers, and even more when participants received evaluative feedback from peers. Peer presence resulted in enhanced activity in several social brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex, temporal parietal junction ( TPJ), precuneus and superior temporal sulcus. TPJ activity correlated with donations, which suggests similar networks for prosocial behavior and sensitivity to peers. These findings highlight the importance of peers in fostering prosocial development throughout adolescence."
1579,Psychology  , Prosocial behavior  , Food sharing; Active transfer; Prosociality; Social bonds; Relationship quality; Orangutans        ,"A variety of studies on food sharing elucidate both its ultimate and proximate functions in non-human primates, especially in Pan. For chimpanzees, food sharing serves as a means to strengthen social relationships. In contrast, little is known about food sharing in orangutans, since their semi-solitary lifestyle barely provides an opportunity to share food outside of the mother-offspring context. However, recent long-term studies suggest that social bonding might play a more important role for orangutans than previously assumed. In zoos, orangutans are often kept in groups and seem to cope with group living quite well. If captive orangutans use food sharing as a social tool, they are expected to share food frequently and selectively with close social partners and to engage frequently in active transfers. We provided three orangutan groups with monopolizable food and recorded all dyadic food-related interactions. For each dyad, we determined the relationship quality and tested whether it predicts food sharing. We found that, in support of our predictions, almost two thirds of interactions involving food resulted in sharing and that the probability for an individual to share food with a particular partner increased with the strength of their relationship. Exceeding our expectations, food sharing occurred even between individuals from two neighboring groups. Finally, a comparison with studies on captive chimpanzees revealed a significantly higher proportion of active transfers for orangutans suggesting species-specific sharing psychologies. Sharing of food is a universal prosocial behavior in humans. Recent research aims to elucidate its adaptive functions and proximate mechanisms by comparison with other species, especially non-human primates, in natural and captive settings. For bonobos and chimpanzees, our closest relatives, the quality of social relationships was revealed to be important for food sharing. In contrast, there is very limited knowledge on food sharing in orangutans, our most distant and semi-solitary living hominid relatives. This study provides the first systematic investigation of food-sharing patterns and the role of relationship quality in captive orangutans. The results demonstrate that group-living orangutans share frequently and selectively with close associates and even more actively than found for chimpanzees. These findings add further evidence supporting the hypothesis that social bonding played a role in the evolution of human prosocial behavior."
1750,Psychology  , Prosocial behavior  , Environment; Regulation; Self-licensing; Voluntary approaches        ,"According to the so-called 'self-licensing effect', committing to a virtuous act in a preceding choice may lead to behave less virtuously in the succeeding decision. Consequently, well-intentioned policies can lead to overall counter-productive effects by licensing people to behave badly in related behaviors. On the other side, motivational crowding theory argues that constraining people to adopt a desirable behavior can backfire. We use of a classroom experiment to test whether a regulatory framework to incentivize individuals to adopt pro-environmental behavior generate similar spillovers in terms of licensing effect than a non-regulatory framework. We show that the way the good deed is caused doesn't seem to influence the licensing effect. Nevertheless, we found that business- and environmental-orientated majors react adversely to the regulatory framework. We show that environmental-orientated students exhibit higher intrinsically motivations than business-orientated ones. Accordingly, we suggest that the licensing effect is more likely to arise when the preceding 'virtuous' act is freely chosen (respectively regulatory caused) for non-intrinsically (respectively intrinsically) motivated individuals."

Working with the children of farmers and herders, we focused on how painful children estimate ostracism to be. Study 1a showed that 4- to 8-year-old children from a socially interdependent farming community estimated ostracism to be less painful than did children from an independent herding community. Study 1b showed that this cultural difference was specific to social pain and did not apply to physical pain. Study 2 replicated the results of Study 1a and showed that individual differences in parents' level of social interdependence mediated the relationship between cultural group and how painful children estimate ostracism to be. Study 3 replicated this effect again and showed that children's tendency to recommend seeking social support following ostracism mediated the relationship between cultural group and the perceived pain of being excluded. Finally, Study 4 investigated cultural differences in moral responses to ostracism and showed that children from the farming community punished an individual who ostracized someone else less harshly than did children from the independent herding community. Thus different economic cultures are associated with striking differences in social interdependence and responses to ostracism from early in development."
2497,Psychology  , Leadership  , communication; electronic; leadership; nursing; organisation; standardised        ,"Aims and objectives. To assess the acceptability and usability of a standardised communication tool for nurses. Background and significance. Communication is key in health care. On a daily, if not hourly, basis, nursing staff is inundated with new information regarding tools and resources, practice changes and the work environment. However, there is currently no standardised messaging or delivery method to effectively communicate new information. Even with a plethora of communication tools such as flyers, posters, emails, unit huddles and unit meetings, there is no means to guarantee attendance to crucial information. Design. Descriptive, cross-sectional online survey, implemented at a nonacademic, suburban hospital with 280 nurses. Methods. The Clinical Chatter, an online tool developed by nursing leadership to standardise messages regarding the organisation, new tools and resources, professional development, recognition and unit updates, was delivered to each nurse on a weekly basis followed by administration of Acceptability and Usability scales. Results. The Clinical Chatter tool has adequate acceptability and usability as a method of communication among nurses in a hospital organisation. Sociodemographic variables of age and years of experience had no statistically significant association with perceived acceptance and usefulness of the tool. Conclusion. The findings indicate that the Clinical Chatter tool can be used as a standardised communication tool to deliver key information among nurses working in a hospital organisation. Nursing leadership must establish and support a clear communication system to enhance patient care and outcomes and improve nursing job satisfaction. Relevance to clinical practice. Communication is vital to advancing health care. Lack of communication among nursing has been linked to unsafe patient care: medication errors, unhealthy work environments and decreased nurse retention rates. Clinical Chatter is an effective communication tool for presentation of institutional information to nursing personnel."
2507,Psychology  , Leadership  , care experience; dementia; hospitals; integrative literature review; nurses        ,"Aims and objectives. To identify and examine existing research exploring how people with dementia and nurses view acute hospital care. Background. Admission to hospital can be traumatic for a person with dementia due to an inability to cope with unfamiliar environments, faces and routines. Adverse behavioural and health outcomes can result. Dementia adds complexity to patient care. Inability to deliver appropriate care is a source of stress and frustration for nurses. Methods. Integrative review of the literature 2005-2015 reporting the experience of people with dementia and nurses caring for them in an acute hospital setting (n = 24). Results. Hospitals focus on acute medical care; consequently people with dementia are considered low priority and a disruption to normal routine. Risk management often takes priority over patient dignity. People with dementia are stigmatised. Families have significant roles to play in the care of a person with dementia in hospital but are often excluded. Nurses struggle to complete even basic patient care, and focus on tasks often at the expense of specific patient needs. Support for nurses is lacking. The job satisfaction of nurses caring for people with dementia is poor. Conclusions. Nurses require improved education and support to care for patients with dementia. Hospitals must focus on genuine caring concurrently with rapid discharge requirements, risk mitigation and fiscal restraint. More research is needed to inform the development of appropriate care for people with dementia in hospitals. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses must understand the complex needs of people with dementia in hospital. Nurse education about dementia, practical support, strong clinical leadership and role-modelling is needed. Empathy for patients regardless of diagnosis must remain a core attribute of nurses. Current hospital culture requires wider system review to mitigate against stigmatisation of patients with dementia."

BackgroundDocumentation of individualized patient care is a continuing concern in healthcare services and could impacts the quality and safety of healthcare. Use of electronic systems has made some aspects of documentation more comprehensive, but creation of an individualized care plan remains a pressing issue. DesignA qualitative descriptive design was used. MethodsAn action research project was conducted between 2010-2012 to improve the content and quality of nursing documentation in community healthcare services in four municipalities. One year after the project was completed four focus group interviews were conducted with healthcare professionals, one for each involved municipality. Two unit managers were interviewed individually. Qualitative content analysis was used. ResultsThree themes emerged: healthcare professionals perceived competing interest; they experienced that they had to manage complexity and changes; and they highlighted a clear and visible leader as important for success. ConclusionsQuality improvement activities are essential. Healthcare professionals experience a complicated situation when electronic health record systems do not support workflow. Further research is recommended to focus on the functionality and user interface of electronic health record systems, and on the role of leadership when implementing changes in clinical practice. Relevance to clinical practiceStronger cooperation among policymakers, electronic health record system vendors, and healthcare professionals is essential for improving electronic health record systems and documentation practices. Involvement of end-users in these improvements can make a difference in the way the systems are perceived in the clinical workflow."
2525,Psychology  , Leadership  , collaboration; culture; global networking; leadership; networking; nursing; quality care; scholarship; survey        ,"Aims and objectivesTo identify how nurse leaders view and experience the opportunities offered by one of the largest global nursing organisations Sigma Theta Tau International. BackgroundWorldwide, nursing leadership is challenged with addressing the complex issues impacting on care delivery. International nursing organisations are a means to bring together individuals to promote leadership and scholarship for nursing practice to promote patient safety and quality care. The newly established all-England chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International is a recent addition to the society in terms of nurse leadership in Europe, as such faces challenges as it establishes its identity and seeks to interpret the organisational vision: to advance world health through nursing leadership and scholarship. Moving forward, members views were sought on the goals of the chapter and how they may be enacted. DesignIn July 2013, all chapter members at that time had been nominated on the basis of achievement in nurse leadership; all were invited to participate in an online survey. The online questionnaire contained a series of closed and open questions. ResultsMost respondents joined because they believed in the vision and networking opportunities Sigma Theta Tau International provides. Three themes were extracted from the data: the value of networking and communication, leadership and the development of culturally sensitive organisations and the need for shared scholarship for nursing practice. ConclusionFindings indicate the growth of effective leadership at all levels of nursing could be harnessed through successful collaboration and keen support for robust connections between practice and education to promote quality care. Relevance to clinical practiceWhilst challenging, globalisation presents an opportunity for a nursing society such as Sigma Theta Tau International to work collaboratively to address healthcare issues. A nursing society that explores and resolves its own complex issues by actively promoting leadership and collaborative scholarship reveals a potential to empower the profession to share our collective solutions towards enhancing clinical practice."
2526,Psychology  , Leadership  , financial rewards; non-financial rewards; nurses' turnover; nursing shortage; qualitative study; Registered nurses; reward satisfaction; total rewards        ,"Aims and objectivesTo identify meaningful types of rewards and the consequences of rewards as expressed by Finnish registered nurses working in primary and private healthcare. BackgroundPrevious studies have found significant associations between nurses' rewards and both their commitment and job satisfaction. Furthermore, appropriate rewards can have beneficial effects on factors including workforce stability and occupational satisfaction that are highly important in times of nurse shortages. DesignA cross-sectional, qualitative interview study. MethodsData were collected via individual semi-structured interviews (n=20) with registered nurses working in Finland's primary and private healthcare, and subjected to qualitative content analysis. ResultsSix meaningful types of rewards were identified by the registered nurses: Financial compensation and benefits, Work-Life balance, Work content, Professional development, Recognition, and Supportive leadership. Rewards encouraged respondents to perform their work correctly and reinforced occupational satisfaction, but also caused feelings of envy and stress. ConclusionsIt is essential to pay attention to nurses' preferences for particular rewards and to reward management. When designing effective reward systems for registered nurses, it is not sufficient to provide financial rewards alone, as various kinds of non-financial rewards are both meaningful and necessary. Relevance to clinical practiceWhen trying to improve registered nurses' commitment and job satisfaction through reward management, it is important to listen to nurses' opinions to create a reward system that integrates financial and non-financial rewards and is fair from their perspective. Healthcare organisations that offer registered nurses a holistic reward system are more likely to retain satisfied and committed nurses at a time of increasing nursing shortages."
1710,Psychology  , Eating disorders  , ADHD; caregivers; caregivers groups and sessions; therapeutic conversation intervention        ,"Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Caregivers of adolescents with ADHD experience major difficulties as care providers and are in need of guidance and support. Adolescents with ADHD may develop oppositional and criminal behaviour. More than 50 % have the symptoms in adulthood, and up to one-fourth with severe emotional or antisocial difficulties. There is a lack of evidence of caregivers supporting intervention although caregiver groups have been found to contribute to better coping, decreased stress and improvements in ADHD symptoms. What does this paper add to existing knowledge? Primary caregivers of adolescents with ADHD experienced better quality of life after the Therapeutic Conversation Intervention. The intervention contributed to better social functioning among secondary caregivers. What are the implications for practice? The content of the Therapeutic Conversation Intervention is significant and highlights the utility of a combination of group and private sessions for caregivers of people with ADHD. The intervention can influence how services for families are organized, such that a Therapeutic Conversation Intervention could be offered on a regular basis. Abstract Introduction Caregivers of adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder are burdened with tasks and many suffer from distress. Adolescents with ADHD may develop antisocial behaviour and caregivers group can empower caregiver's supporting role. Aim/Question To evaluate the effectiveness of a Therapeutic Conversation Intervention on caregivers of adolescents with ADHD regarding strengthening the supportive role. Method The study utilized a quasi-experimental design. The participants (n=60) were caregivers of adolescents (13-17years old) with ADHD. The intervention consisted in-group and parent sessions. The Calgary Family Model and the Family Illness Beliefs Model were used as theoretical frameworks. Results The study revealed significant differences in the improvement of quality of life; regarding primary caregiver (PC) worry, daily activities, family relationships and collaboration post-intervention, as well emotional functioning at both post-intervention and follow-up. Secondary caregiver (SC) social functioning was significantly improved at follow-up. Discussion The intervention proved to be beneficial to the caregivers and is filling a gap in much needed intervention. Implication for practice The results will expand health care professionals' knowledge of how to increase PC quality of life when supporting their adolescent with ADHD. This treatment information should improve service at health care centres/hospitals where adolescents with ADHD receive care."
1975,Psychology  , Eating disorders  , Adolescents; LGBT youth; Eating disorders; Body image; Mental health; Gender identity        ,"Adolescence is a crucial period for emerging sexual orientation and gender identity and also body image disturbance and disordered eating. Body image distortion and disordered eating are important pediatric problems affecting individuals along the sexual orientation and gender identity spectrum. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) youth are at risk for eating disorders and body dissatisfaction. Disordered eating in LGBT and gender variant youth may be associated with poorer quality of life and mental health outcomes. Pediatricians should know that these problems occur more frequently in LGBT youth. There is evidence that newer treatment paradigms involving family support are more effective than individual models of care."
1980,Psychology  , Eating disorders  , adolescent nutrition; physiology; nutritional requirements; adolescents        ,"Adolescence is the period of development that begins at puberty and ends in early adulthood. Most commonly, adolescence is divided into three developmental periods: early adolescence (10-14 years of age), late adolescence (15-19 years of age), and young adulthood (20-24 years of age). Adolescence is marked by physical and sexual maturation, social and economic independence, development of identity, acquisition of skills needed to carry out adult relationships and roles, and the capacity for abstract reasoning. Adolescence is characterized by a rapid pace of growth that is second only to that of infancy. Nutrition and the adolescent transition are closely intertwined, since eating patterns and behaviors are influenced by many factors, including peer influences, parental modeling, food availability, food preferences, cost, convenience, personal and cultural beliefs, mass media, and body image. Here, we describe the physiology, metabolism, and nutritional requirements for adolescents and pregnant adolescents, as well as nutrition-related behavior and current trends in adolescent nutrition. We conclude with thoughts on the implications for nutrition interventions and priority areas that would require further investigation."
2291,Psychology  , Eating disorders  , Anorexia nervosa; Male; Culture; Acculturation; Parent-child relationship; Transcultural psychiatry        ,"Aim. Anorexia nervosa was long considered as a culture-bound syndrome of Western countries. However, studies have found anorexics in other cultures, for instance in China. The prevalence and incidence of anorexia in China seem lower than in the West, but on the increase, which suggests an influence of cultural factors. Anorexia could thus be a culture-change syndrome arising during fast sociocultural changes on individual scale, on the occasion of a migration, or on societal scale. Transcultural psychiatrists consider that acculturation and culture clash (conflict between different cultural models) are risk factors for developing eating disorders. Further to this, knowledge of male anorexia nervosa is limited, and there are few studies on this pathology in a transcultural setting. Method. From a clinical illustration of male anorexia in China, our purpose is to show the impact of cultural and transcultural factors on the emergence, the psychopathology, the symptomatology and the care of male anorexia in a society experiencing rapid change. Results. Zang presented atypical symptoms: absence of denial of weight-loss, transitory fat phobia, and atypical food restrictions. He also presented symptoms that are found in descriptions of cases in Western countries, such as perfectionism, obsessional disorders and autonomy difficulties. The development of Zang's anorexia seemed linked to a culture clash and an acculturation process. Discussion. The absence of any denial of weight-loss by Zang and his transitory fat phobia could be explained by the traditional non-valuation of thinness in China. Abdominal pains could be an accepted idiom for distress in China for patients suffering from anorexia nervosa and might reflect social disharmony. With Zang, the culture clash shows itself in his desire on one hand to decide for himself on his own future and on the other hand his filial duty. Acculturation could explain the development of pathological eating behaviours via a valuation of dieting attitudes and the adoption of an ideal of thinness. Concerning the therapeutic approach, family therapy adapted to the Chinese setting seemed appropriate for this patient, mainly to redefine his own way of being a good son. Conclusion. This clinical case questions the use of Western diagnostic criteria, the meaning of symptoms, and the relevant therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from anorexia outside Western countries. The transcultural approach enables a reconceptualization and an enrichment of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to male anorexia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
2346,Psychology  , Eating disorders  , Eating disorders; anorexia nervosa; bulimia nervosa; eating disorder examination questionnaire; clinical impairment assessment; norms        ,"Aim: The aim of the current study was to collect clinical normative data for the Clinical Impairment Assessment questionnaire (CIA) and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) from adult patients with eating disorders (EDs). This study also examined unique contributions of eating disorder (ED) symptoms on levels of ED-related impairment.Methods: A sample of 667 patients, 620 females and 47 males, was recruited from six specialist centres across Norway. The majority of the sample (40.3%) was diagnosed with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), 34.5% had bulimia nervosa (BN), and 25.2% were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN).Results: There were significant differences for global EDE-Q and CIA scores between females and males. In the female sample, significant differences were found on several EDE-Q sub-scales between the AN and BN group, and between the AN and EDNOS group. No significant differences were found between the diagnostic groups on the CIA. In the male sample, no significant differences were found between diagnostic groups on the EDE-Q or CIA. A multiple regression analysis revealed that 46.8% of the variance in impairment as measured by the CIA was accounted for by ED symptoms.Conclusions: Body mass index, Eating Concern, Shape/Weight Concern, and binge eating served as significant, unique predictors of impairment. The results from the present study contribute to the interpretation of EDE-Q and CIA scores in ED samples."

The axis is an endocrine system responsible for coping with stress and it is likely to be involved in depression. The dynamics of the system is studied and existence, uniqueness and positivity of the solution and the existence of an attracting trapping region are proved. The model is calibrated and compared to data for healthy and depressed subjects. A sensitivity analysis resulting in a set of identifiable physiological parameters is provided. A subset is selected for parameter estimation and a reduced version of the model is stated and an approximated version is discussed. The model is physiologically based, thus parameters are representative for gland functions or elimination processes. Hence the model may be used for pointing out pathologies by parameter estimation and hypothesis testing whereby it may be used as an objective and refined method for diagnosing depression and suggesting individual treatment protocols. Finally, the method may inspire pharmaceutical companies to develop target specific psychopharmaca for more effective and individual treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Among the compounds evaluated herein, 3-chloro-N-(1-[3-(1,1-biphenyl-2-yloxy)2-hydroxypropylIpiperidin-4-yl}benzenesulfonamide (25) exhibited antagonistic properties at 5HT(7)R and showed selectivity over selected serotoninergic and dopaminergic receptors, as well as over serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine transporters. Compound 25 demonstrated significant antidepressant -like activity in the forced swim test (0.625-2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and in the tail suspension test (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.), augmented the antidepressant effect of inactive doses of escitalopram (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and bupropion (dopamine reuptake inhibitor) in the FST in mice, and similarly to 5B269970, exerted pro-cognitive properties in the novel object recognition task in cognitively unimpaired conditions in rats (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.). Such an extended pharmacological profile, especially the augmentation effect of the identified 5-5HT(7)R antagonist on SSRI activity, seems promising regarding the complexity of affective disorders and potentially improved outcomes, including mnemonic performance.

1236,Psychology  , Depression  , competitive effort; injuries; life span; Nicrophorus vespilloides; reproductive success; terminal investment        ,"A recent theoretical model suggests that intraspecific competition is an important determinant of the severity of inbreeding depression. The reason for this is that intraspecific competition is density dependent, leading to a stronger negative effect on inbred individuals if they are weaker competitors than outbred ones. In support of this prediction, previous empirical work shows that inbred individuals are weaker competitors than outbred ones and that intraspecific competition often exacerbates inbreeding depression. Here, we report an experiment on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, in which we recorded the outcome of competition over a small vertebrate carcass between an inbred or outbred male resident caring for a brood and a size-matched inbred or outbred male intruder. We found that inbred males were more successful as intruders in taking over a carcass from a male resident and were injured more frequently as either residents or intruders. Furthermore, inbred males gained less mass during the breeding attempt and had a shorter adult life span than outbred males. Finally, successful resident males reared a substantially smaller brood comprised of lighter larvae when the intruder was inbred than when it was outbred. Our results shows that inbred males increased their competitive effort, thus contradicting previous work suggesting that inbred males are weaker competitors. Furthermore, our results shows that inbred intruders impose a greater cost to resident males, suggesting that outbred individuals can suffer fitness costs as a result of competition with inbred ones."

Almost all (98 %) experienced persecution due to their sexual orientation and 84 % were survivors of torture. The circumstances under which the disclosure of sexual orientation took place in the country of origin were often traumatic. In several, efforts were made to change their sexual orientation often through forced marriage. Those in same sex relationships had relationships often marred by tragedy. Women were more likely to be forced to move from place to place, experience rape/sexual assault and threats whereas men were more likely to be persecuted by people on the street. All presented with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Providers need to be attuned to the potential traumatic histories of those fleeing persecution due to sexual orientation, and the medical, social, psychological, and legal implications."

Evidence suggests that the G allele of this polymorphism is associated with higher levels of sensitivity. This study tested for main effects of the polymorphism and its interaction with a self-report measure of childhood adversity as an index of negative environment. Outcomes were several personality measures relevant to social connection. Significant interactions were obtained, such that the negative impact of childhood adversity on personality was greater among G carriers than among A homozygotes on measures of agreeableness, interdependence, anger proneness, hostility, authentic pride, life engagement, and an index of (mostly negative) feelings coloring one's world view. Findings support the role of OPRM1 in sensitivity to negative environments. Limitations are noted, including the lack of a measure of advantageous social environment to assess sensitivity to positive social contexts."
1250,Psychology  , Borderline personality disorder  , Childhood trauma; Psychosis; Parenting rearing style; Severe mental disorder        ,"A relation between different types of parental care, trauma in childhood and psychotic symptoms in adulthood has been proposed. The nature of this association is not clear and if it is more related to psychotic disorders per se or to a cluster of symptoms such as positive psychotic symptoms remains undefined. We have analysed the presence of childhood trauma using the CTQ scale and types of parental care using the PBI scale in three groups of subjects: borderline personality disorder patients (n=36), first psychotic episode patients (n=61) and healthy controls (n=173). Positive psychotic symptomatology was assessed with the CAPE scale. General linear models were used to study the relation between positive psychotic symptomatology and variables of interest. BPD patients had the highest rate of any kind of trauma, followed by FEP patients. We found a positive relationship between psychotic symptomatology and the existence of trauma in childhood in all groups. Moreover, an affectionless control rearing style was directly associated with the existence of trauma. Furthermore, subjects with trauma presented less probability of having an optimal parenting style in childhood. The relation between psychotic symptoms and trauma remained statistically significant after adjusting for other variables including parental rearing style. There seems to be a link between trauma in childhood and psychotic symptomatology across different populations independently of psychiatric diagnosis. Taking into account that there is an association between trauma and psychosis and that trauma is a modifiable factor, clinicians should pay special attention to these facts."

Both groups were administered the Multidimensional Inventory of Dissociation (MID). DID patients had significantly higher MID scores than BPD patients, different distributions of MID scores, and different MID subscale profiles in 3 ranges of MID scores (0-15, 15-30, 30-45). The core MID symptoms-exhibited at all ranges of MID scores-for DID patients (the presence of alters, identity confusion, and memory problems) and BPD patients (flashbacks, identity confusion, and memory problems) were ostensibly similar but were considered to be mostly produced by different underlying processes. Multiple regression analyses showed that the core MID symptoms of DID patients had different predictors than did the core MID symptoms of BPD patients. Alter identities seemed to generate most-but not all-dissociative phenomena in DID patients, whereas only the 24% highest scoring BPD patients (MID >= 45) seemed to manifest alter-driven dissociative experiences. Most BPD dissociative experiences appeared to be due to 5 other mechanisms: (a) BPD-specific, stress-driven, rapid shifts of self-state; (b and c) nondefensive disruptions of the framework of perceptual organization with or without an accompanying BPD-specific, dissociation-like disintegration of affective/neurocognitive functioning; (d) a defensive distancing or detachment from distress (i.e., simple depersonalization); and (e) Allen, Console, and Lewis's (1999) severe absorptive detachment."

It helps people who are living in the community and also living in hospitals and people who may have problems managing their emotions. In recent years, dialectical behaviour therapy has been used to help people with learning disabilities cope with feelings of anxiety, trauma-related disorders and mood disorders, but there are not many research papers showing how it is used in forensic learning disability services. This research tells the story of seven women with learning disabilities who took part in dialectical behaviour therapy whilst living in a forensic service. Their story and experiences are important in research literature and will help other services to think about what is needed when they introduce a new type of therapy such as dialectical behaviour therapy . Abstract Background This research aimed to capture the experiences of women with learning disabilities living in secure services who undertook dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT); they were the first people to do this in the trust. It is hoped their experiences may guide and inform other services undertaking the same process. Materials and Methods Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to provide a flexible framework to make sense of the way the women interpreted their experiences. Results and Discussion The analysis identified three main themes: How you do DBT, What we think about DBT, Using DBT. The qualitative approach adds a valuable contribution to the wider literature, highlighting the importance of capturing the women's voices. Conclusion As most published literature regarding the effectiveness of DBT is not written from first hand service user experiences, it is hoped this research offers a unique insight into these women's experience."

Learning disability nursing in the area of people with a learning disability and an offending background has developed considerably over recent years, particularly since the publication of the Bradley (). There has been limited work into the competencies nurses require to work in this area, and even less about the personal attributes of learning disability nurses. Learning disability nursing's specific contribution to the care of this population lies in their knowledge of the interaction between the learning disability, an individual's, sometimes abusive, personal history and an understanding of the subsequent offending behaviour. The knowledge base of nurses working with people with learning disabilities and an offending background needs to reflect the changing service user group. This is particularly in relation to substance misuse, borderline personality disorder, and mental health and the way such factors inter-relate with the learning disability. What are the implications for practice? Further research is required into the relationship among decision making, risk taking or reluctance to do this, and the personal attributes required by nurses to work in secure learning disability care. Learning disability secure services are likely to continue to undergo change as circumstances alter and the offending population demonstrate greater complexity; nursing competencies and personal attributes need similarly to adapt to such changes. Mental health nursing has a great deal to contribute to effective working with this population, specifically with regard to developing strong relationships when concerns around borderline personality disorder or substance misuse are particularly in evidence. Abstract Aim To identify and discuss the personal attributes required by learning disability nurses to work effectively with people with an offending background in secure and community settings. Background This study was part of a larger research investigation into the nursing competencies required to work with people with an offending background. There are few existing studies examining the personal attributes necessary for working with this group. Design A qualitative study addressing the perceptions of nurses around the personal attributes required to work with people with learning disabilities and an offending background. Methods A semi-structured interview schedule was devised and constructed, and 39 individual interviews were subsequently undertaken with learning disability nurses working in high, medium, low secure and community settings. Data were collected over 1 year in 2010/11 and analysed using a structured thematic analysis supported by the software package MAXqda. Findings The thematic analysis produced three categories of personal attributes, named as looking deeper, achieving balance and connecting, each of which contained a further three sub-categories. Conclusion Nursing of those with a learning disability and an offending background continues to develop. The interplay among personal history, additional background factors, nurses' personal attributes and learning disability is critical for effective relationship building."

Agomelatine's antidepressant actions are attributed to its sleep-promoting and chronobiotic actions mediated by MT1 and MT2 receptors present in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as to its effects on the blockade of 5-HT2c receptors. Blockade of 5-HT2c receptors causes release of both noradrenaline and dopamine at the fronto-cortical dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways. The combined actions of agomelatine on MT1/MT2 and 5-HT2c receptors facilitate the resynchronization of altered circadian rhythms and abnormal sleep patterns. Agomelatine appeared to be effective in treating major depression. Moreover, evidence exists that points out a possible efficacy of such drug in the treatment of bipolar depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol dependence, migraines etc. Thus, the aim of this narrative review was to elucidate current evidences on the role of agomelatine in disorders other than major depression."

Higher mood seasonality was observed for university students born during spring or summer months (long photoperiod) compared to those born during autumn or winter months (short photoperiod). The aim of this study was to test the hypothesized photoperiod effect by comparing the correlation between month of birth and mood seasonality in two countries located at the opposite poles of the terrestrial globe: Italy (northern hemisphere) and New Zealand (southern hemisphere). On the basis of the photoperiod-at-birth hypothesis, we expected to find higher mood seasonality among individuals born in months with longer photoperiods in both countries. Methods The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire was administered to 1514 young adults (1088 women, 426 men; 1027 Italians, 487 New Zealanders), with ages ranging from 18 to 34 years. The Global Seasonality Score, which is a measure of mood seasonality, was calculated from the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire. Results A significant overall month-of-birth effect was observed on the Global Seasonality Score, but only for men. Men born in April and August (corresponding in Italy to a long photoperiod, in New Zealand to a short photoperiod) had higher mood seasonality than those born in February, regardless of country. Conclusions A significant month-of-birth effect was found on mood seasonality, but results do not support the hypothesis based on the photoperiod effect."
2613,Psychology  , Seasonal affective disorder  , lighting design; elderly; biological effects; built environment        ,"Aims: Research suggests that specialised lighting design is essential to cater for the elderly users of a building because of reduced visual performance with increased age. This review aims to document what is known of the physical and psychological aspects of lighting and their role in promoting a healthy and safe environment for the elderly. Methods: A methodical review was carried out of published literature on the physical and psychological impacts of light on the elderly. Design standards and guides from professional organizations were evaluated to identify synergies and gaps between the evidence base and current practice. Results: Lighting has been identified as a significant environmental attribute responsible for promoting physical and mental health of the elderly. The evidence related to visual performance was found to be robust. However, guides and standards appeared to have focused mostly on illumination requirements for specific tasks and have lacked detailed guidelines on vertical lighting and luminance design. This review has identified a growing body of evidence on the therapeutic benefits of lighting and its use in treating psychological disorders among the elderly. The experiments using light as a therapy have improved our understanding of the underlying principles, but the integration of therapeutic aspects of lighting in design practice and guidelines is lacking. Conclusions: While design guidelines discuss the physical needs of lighting for the elderly fairly well, they lack incorporation of photobiological impacts. Despite positive outcomes from research, the implementation of therapeutic aspects of lighting in buildings is still debatable due to insufficient relevant investigations and robustness of their findings. Collaborations between designers and physicians can contribute in delivering customised lighting solutions by considering disease types and needs. Further investigation needs to be carried out for translating therapeutic benefits to photometric units to implement them in building lighting design."
2856,Psychology  , Seasonal affective disorder  , homeostasis; circadian rhythms; psychiatry; genetics; mood disorders; anxiety disorder        ,"All living organisms depend on homeostasis, the complex set of interacting metabolic chemical reactions for maintaining life and well-being. This is no less true for psychiatric well-being than for physical well-being. Indeed, a focus on homeostasis forces us to see how inextricably linked mental and physical well-being are. This paper focuses on these linkages. In particular, it addresses the ways in which understanding of disturbed homeostasis may aid in creating classes of patients with mood and anxiety disorders based on such phenotypes. At the cellular level, we may be able to compensate for the inability to study living brain tissue through the study of homeostatic mechanisms in fibroblasts, pluripotent human cells, and mitochondria and determine how homeostasis is disturbed at the level of these peripheral tissues through exogenous stress. We also emphasize the remarkable opportunities for enhancing knowledge in this area that are offered by advances in technology. The study of human behavior, especially when combined with our greatly improved capacity to study unique but isolated populations, offers particularly clear windows into the relationships among genetic, environmental, and behavioral contributions to homeostasis."
2975,Psychology  , Seasonal affective disorder  , photoperiod; depression; neuroplasticity        ,"Although animal research has demonstrated seasonal changes in hippocampal volume, reflecting seasonal neuroplasticity, seasonal differences in human hippocampal volume have yet to be documented. Hippocampal volume has also been linked to depressed mood, a seasonally varying phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized that seasonal differences in day-length (i.e., photoperiod) would predict differences in hippocampal volume, and that this association would be linked to low mood. Healthy participants aged 30-54 (M=43; SD=7.32) from the University of Pittsburgh Adult Health and Behavior II project (n=404; 53% female) were scanned in a 3T MRI scanner. Hippocampal volumes were determined using an automated segmentation algorithm using FreeSurfer. A mediation model tested whether hippocampal volume mediated the relationship between photoperiod and mood. Secondary analyses included seasonally fluctuating variables (i.e., sleep and physical activity) which have been shown to influence hippocampal volume. Shorter photoperiods were significantly associated with higher BDI scores (R-2=0.01, =-0.12, P=0.02) and smaller hippocampal volumes (R-2=0.40, =0.08, P=0.04). However, due to the lack of an association between hippocampal volume and Beck Depression Inventory scores in the current sample, the mediation hypothesis was not supported. This study is the first to demonstrate an association between season and hippocampal volume. These data offer preliminary evidence that human hippocampal plasticity could be associated with photoperiod and indicates a need for longitudinal studies. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2240,Medical , Schizophrenia  , pre-diabetes; diabetes; obesity; OGTT; fasting glucose; screening        ,"Aim Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are highly prevalent among individuals with serious mental illness and increased by antipsychotic medication. Although widely recommended, many obstacles prevent these patients from obtaining a proper screening for dysglycemia. Currently, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose, and 2-hour glucose levels from the oral glucose tolerance test are used for screening prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate if HbA1c could be used as the only screening test among individuals with serious mental illness. Methods Cross sectional study comparing the sensitivity of HbA1c, fasting glucose, and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test to detect dysglycemias in serious mental illness participants referred for metabolic complications. Results A total of 84 participants (43 female; aged: 38.5 +/- 12.8 years; BMI: 35.0 +/- 6.8 kg/m(2)) was included. Regarding prediabetes, 44, 44 and 76 % were identified by HbA1c, fasting glucose, and 2 h-oral glucose tolerance test respectively and for type 2 diabetes, 60, 53 and 66 % were identified by HbA1c, fasting glucose and 2 h-oral glucose tolerance test. The overlap between the 3 markers was low (8 % of participants for prediabetes and 26 % for Type 2 diabetes). Sensitivity of HbA1c were moderate (range 40-62.5 %), while its specificity was excellent (92-93 %). Conclusion The present study indicates a low agreement between HbA1c, fasting glucose and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test. It appears that these markers do not identify the same participants. Thus, HbA1c may not be used alone to detect all glucose abnormalities among individuals with serious mental illness."
2327,Psychology  , Schizophrenia  , CAYR; indicated prevention; psychosocial intervention; stress; ultra-high risk for psychosis        ,"Aim: In the context of an increasing focus on indicated prevention of psychotic disorders, we describe the operation of the Clinic for Assessment of Youth at Risk (CAYR) over 10 years, a specialized service for identification, monitoring and treatment of young individuals who meet ultra-high risk (UHR) criteria for psychosis, and its integration within the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP) in Montreal, Canada. Methods: We outline rationale, development, inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessment, services offered, community outreach and liaison with potential referral sites, and our research focus on risk and protective factors related to the neural diathesis-stress model of psychosis. Results: Between January 2005 and December 2014, CAYR has received 370 referrals and accepted 177 patients who met UHR criteria based on the Comprehensive Assessment for At Risk Mental States. Conversion rates to a first episode of psychosis were 11%. Our research findings point to high subjective stress levels, poor self-esteem, social support and coping skills, and a dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis during the high-risk phase. Conclusions: Our efforts at community outreach have resulted in increasing numbers of referrals and patients accepted to CAYR, highlighting the relevance of and need for a high-risk programme in the Montreal area. Patients with psychotic symptoms can be immediately assigned to the first-episode psychosis clinic within PEPP, which has likely contributed to the low conversion rates observed in the UHR group. Our research findings on stress and protective factors emphasize the importance of psychosocial interventions for high-risk patients."
2345,Psychology  , Schizophrenia  , anxiety; depression; hallucination; neuroticism; psychotic disorder        ,"Aim: Sub-threshold psychotic experiences (PEs) are common in the general population and may increase risk for psychological distress and psychosis onset, generating a need for effective community screening instruments. This study aimed to explore the utility of a brief, self-report, psychosis risk screening tool in predicting perceived need for psychological treatment among a non-clinical sample, above and beyond that accounted for by accompanying forms of psychopathology or trait neuroticism. Methods: Construct validity, predictive validity and test-retest reliability of the brief, self-report questionnaire for screening putative prepsychotic states were determined among college students (N = 679). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between PEs and perceived need for psychological services. Results: With the exception of auditory perceptual disturbances, PEs were not significantly associated with one's need for services, or the belief from others that services are needed, after controlling for neuroticism, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Auditory perceptual disturbances were significantly associated with the perceived need for psychological services, even after accounting for these additional symptoms. Conclusions: These results confirm the usefulness of the psychosis risk screening tool in evaluating the presence of sub-threshold PEs, particularly auditory perceptual disturbances. The relationship between other PEs and a perceived need for psychological services, however, was largely explained by the existence of neurotic traits and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Screening for auditory perceptual disturbances may be useful in identifying unmet clinical need among young adults."
2362,Psychology  , Schizophrenia  , coping; first-episode schizophrenia; high-risk research; prodrome; schizophrenia        ,"Aim: The concept of coping is central to recent models of psychosis. The aim of the present paper is to explore whether specific coping styles relate to certain stages of the disorder. Methods: Thirty-nine clients at clinical high risk (CHR) of first-episode psychosis, 19 clients with first-episode psychosis and 52 clients with multiple-episode psychosis completed a Stress Coping Questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of 114 items defining one overall positive coping scale (with three subscales) and one negative coping scale. Analyses of variance with group as between-subject factor and coping behaviour as within-subject factor were used to identify different coping patterns. Results: On the level of subscales no group differences could be detected, but analysis of variance revealed slightly different patterns: CHR clients used significantly more negative than positive coping styles (P = 0.001), followed by patients with multiple-episode psychosis (P = 0.074). Firstepisode patients were most likely to use negative as well as positive coping (P = 0.960). Across all stages of illness, stress control was significantly preferred compared to the other positive coping styles distraction and devaluation. Again, this pattern was especially pronounced for at-risk clients and patients with multiple-episode psychosis, whereas patients with first-episode psychosis were most likely to use devaluation as well as distraction. Conclusions: The overall coping styles were similar across the different stages of psychosis. However, at-risk persons presented especially pronounced negative coping and a small range of strategies, indicating a specific need for psychosocial support in this stage of the disorder."
2368,Psychology  , Schizophrenia  , schizophrenia; ERBB4; BACE1; polymorphism; association        ,"Aim: The NRG1-ERBB4 neurotransmitter signaling pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SZ). The intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism rs707284 in ERBB4 links to PI3K-AKT suppression in SZ. Another protein indirectly affecting NRG1-ERBB4 signaling is beta-secretase, which is encoded by the BACE1 gene, and activates NRG1 by proteolytic cleavage. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of ERBB4 rs707284 and BACE1 rs490460 with the risk of SZ in an Iranian population. Subjects and Methods: A total of 973 subjects, including 480 SZ patients and 493 healthy controls, matched by ethnicity, age, and gender, were recruited in a case-control study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of all subjects and genotyping of rs707284 and rs490460 was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism and tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (tetra-ARMS) PCR genotyping assays, respectively. Results: A significant association was observed between the rs490460 T allele and SZ (p = 0.0002, odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.84). There was no association between the risk of SZ and rs707284. Conclusion: Our data indicate that rs490460 is associated with the risk of SZ. In silico analysis indicates that rs490460 may be a potential splicing site, which affects protein structure. Replication studies are needed to confirm our data."
1721,Psychology  , Antisocial personality disorder  , antisocial; core beliefs; personality disorder; schemas        ,"According to cognitive theories of personality disorders, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is based upon a distinct set of cognitive-behavioral representations. The aim of this study is to examine this supposition by comparing the early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) and core beliefs of young antisocial men with those of a set of socio-demographically matched, psychiatrically healthy individuals. We used the Schema Questionnaire (SQ-SF) and the Social Comparison Scale (SCS) to identify and evaluate subjects' EMSs and core beliefs. Thirty-eight antisocial individuals and 24 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Results of the SCS indicated that antisocial patients see themselves as unlovable, lonely, and rejected. Results of the SQ-SF indicated that antisocial patients had significantly elevated and clinically relevant scores in comparison to controls in the following areas: emotional deprivation, entitlement/grandiosity, mistrust/abuse, vulnerability to harm and illness, and social isolation. In general, the results of the present study tentatively indicate that while ASPD individuals demonstrate a common profile of core beliefs, these are not unique to individuals diagnosed with ASPD. The implications of these findings are discussed for cognitive behavioral theory, and treatment of ASPD."
2015,Psychology  , Antisocial personality disorder  , Adverse family environment; Maladaptive behaviors in adulthood; Longitudinal study; Structural equation modeling        ,"Adult maladaptive behaviors including antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and marijuana use are major public health concerns. At the present time, there is a dearth of research showing the interrelationships among the possible predictors of adult maladaptive behaviors (i.e., ASPD and marijuana use). Therefore, the current study examines the pathways from adverse family environments in late adolescence to these maladaptive behaviors in adulthood. There were 674 participants (52 % African Americans, 48 % Puerto Ricans). Sixty percent of the sample was female. Structural equation modeling in the current study included 4 waves of data collection (mean ages 19, 24, 29, and 36). An adverse family environment in late adolescence was related to greater externalizing personality in late adolescence, which in turn, was related to greater marijuana use in emerging adulthood. This in turn was positively associated with partner marijuana use in young adulthood, which in turn, was ultimately related to maladaptive behaviors in adulthood. An adverse family environment in late adolescence was also related to greater marijuana use in emerging adulthood, which in turn, was associated with an adverse relationship with one's partner in young adulthood. Such a negative partner relationship was related to maladaptive behaviors in adulthood. The findings suggest that family-focused interventions (Kumpfer and Alvarado in Am Psychol 58(6-7): 457-465, 2003) for dysfunctional families may be most helpful when they include the entire family."

This review explores new trends and prominent issues associated with injection drug use. The dynamic nature of injection drug use is underlined by examining its recent trends and changing patterns in Canada and other ""high-income countries.'' Three research topics that could further contribute to the development of comprehensive prevention and intervention strategies aimed at people who inject drugs are also discussed: risk behaviours associated with the injection of prescription opioids, binge injection drug use, and mental health problems as determinants of injection risk behaviours."
2172,Psychology  , Antisocial personality disorder  , aggression; genetics; association studies; GWAS; candidate genes        ,"Aggressive behavior has both genetic and environmental components. Many association studies have been performed to identify genetic factors underlying aggressive behaviors in humans. In this review we summarize the previous work performed in this field, considering both candidate gene (CGAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), excluding those performed in samples where the primary diagnosis is a psychiatric or neurological disorder other than an aggression-related phenotype. Subsequently, we have studied the enrichment of pathways and functions in GWAS data. The results of our searches show that most CGAS have identified associations with genes involved in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission and in hormone regulation. On the other hand, GWAS have not yet identified genome-wide significant associations, but top nominal findings are related to several signaling pathways, such as axon guidance or estrogen receptor signaling, and also to neurodevelopmental processes and synaptic plasticity. Future studies should use larger samples, homogeneous phenotypes and standardized measurements to identify genes that underlie aggressive behaviors in humans. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2175,Psychology  , Antisocial personality disorder  , aggressive behavior; tryptophan; serotonin; kynurenine; biomarkers        ,"Aggressive behavior is one of themost challenging symptomsin psychiatry, and biological markers for aggression lack of large sample validations. Serotonin (5-HT) and other neuroactive compounds deriving from Tryptophan (Trp), including kynurenine (Kyn), have not yet been investigated in large cohorts of aggressive individuals to validate their potential as biomarkers of aggression. In 361 male inmates we measured serum levels of Trp, 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HT, Kyn, the ratios 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000 and Kyn/Trp (*) 1000, and performed Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I and -II Disorders (SCID-I and -II), global assessment of functioning (GAF), and scales for aggressive behavior, impulsivity, adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligent quotient (IQ). Aggressive compared to non-aggressive inmates exhibited lower Trp and Kyn serum levels but higher levels of 5-HT and 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000, higher levels of impulsivity and ADHD indices, lower IQ and GAF, higher prevalence of mood disorders, drug abuse/dependence, and borderline, conduct and antisocial behaviors. Interestingly, Kyn/Trp (*) 1000 was positively correlated to the number of severe aggressive acts (r = 0.593, P < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis indicated that 5-HT/Trp (*) 1000, antisocial behavior, and GAF were predictors of aggressive behavior. The model combining these three predictors had an area under the ROC curve of 0.851 (95% CI 0.806-0.895). This study indicates that while circulating Trp is reduced in aggressive individuals, the combination of biological (5-HT/Trp ratio) and psychopathological (antisocial behavior and GAF) markers discriminates between aggressive and non-aggressive behavior suggesting the potential of a multi-marker approach in psychiatry given the heterogenic nature of mental diseases.

Attention is growing about the risk of adolescents to become victims of aggression perpetrated by peers with new technology. In September 2006, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a panel of experts in technology and youth aggression to examine this specific risk. This special issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health presents the data and recommendations for future directions discussed at the meeting.

It is unknown, however, how the extent of violent media use and the severity of aggression displayed affect adolescents' brain function. We investigated skin conductance responses, brain activation and functional brain connectivity to media violence in healthy adolescents. In an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, subjects repeatedly viewed normed videos that displayed different degrees of aggressive behavior. We found a downward linear adaptation in skin conductance responses with increasing aggression and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. Our results further revealed adaptation in a fronto-parietal network including the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), right precuneus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules, again showing downward linear adaptations and desensitization towards more aggressive videos. Granger causality mapping analyses revealed attenuation in the left lOFC, indicating that activation during viewing aggressive media is driven by input from parietal regions that decreased over time, for more aggressive videos. We conclude that aggressive media activates an emotion-attention network that has the capability to blunt emotional responses through reduced attention with repeated viewing of aggressive media contents, which may restrict the linking of the consequences of aggression with an emotional response, and therefore potentially promotes aggressive attitudes and behavior."

To examine possible historical trends in MPAA ratings information, the present study analyzed the content of PG, PG-13, and R movie rating justification phrases (e.g., ""Rated PG-13 for violence and language"") applied to movies released in the years 1993-2005. A random sample of 1820 movie titles was selected, and all words in the rating justification phrases were coded as primary content terms or modifier terms. Results indicated that content terms for language, violence, and sexuality appeared frequently at all rating levels. Historical trends were found for terms indicating stronger depictions of violence and language and more mature thematic material in PG movie phrases, and more adult language, substance use, and sexual content in PG-13 movie phrases, across the sampled years, a pattern termed ""ratings creep."" Policy changes and psychological processes affecting MPAA raters and the ratings process are discussed as plausible causes of ratings creep, as are implications of these ratings changes for media consumers and society at large."
2171,Psychology  , Media violence  , aggression questionnaire; hostility; anger; measurement; external validity        ,"Aggression research often relies upon convenient samples with unknown generalizability to populations of interest, potentially threatening external validity. This article details the measurement properties of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire Short Form (BPAQ-SF) and its subscales in two nationally representative U.S. samples (N = 924) and a concurrent study with U.S. college students (N = 384). The results provide useful benchmarks for generalizing BPAQ-SF results from convenient samples to U. S. adults, including distributions, reliability, and factor structure. The results also confirm basic relationships between trait aggression and key social and demographic variables such as sex, age, and socioeconomic status while establishing convergent validity with violent political attitudes. Results from the national studies closely align with those from the student sample, providing reasonable support for generalizing trait aggression elements to U.S. adults.

349,Psychology  , Prenatal development  , teratogenic severity; embryo; fetal developmental toxicity; safety assessment        ,"A developing organism exposed to a toxicant will have a response that ranges from none to severe (i.e., death or malformation). The response at a given dosage may be termed teratogenic (or developmental toxic) severity and is dependent on exposure conditions. Prenatal/embryo-fetal developmental (EFD) toxicity studies in rodents and rabbits are the most consistent and definitive assessments of teratogenic severity, and teratogenesis screening assays are best validated against their results. A formula is presented that estimates teratogenic severity for each group, including control, within an EFD study. The developmental components include embryonic/fetal death, malformations, variations, and mean fetal weight. The contribution of maternal toxicity is included with multiplication factors to adjust for the extent of mortality, maternal body weight change, and other parameters deemed important. The derivation of the formula to calculate teratogenic severity is described. Various EFD data sets from the literature are presented to highlight considerations to the calculation of the various components of the formula. Each score is compared to the concurrent control group to obtain a relative teratogenic severity. The limited studies presented suggest relative scores of two- to <fivefold higher than control have detectable but a low level of teratogenic severity, and scores fivefold higher than control have increasingly more severe teratogenicity. Such scores may help refine the concept of an exposure-based validation list for use by proponents of screening assays (Daston etal., 2014) by estimating the severity of positive exposures, or in other situations by defining the severity of a LOAEL (lowest observed adverse effect level).

590,Psychology  , Prenatal development  , Sexual differentiation; Gender typing; Gender development; Organizational hormones; Androgen; Puberty; Pubertal hormones; Gender identity; Gender role; Sexual orientation        ,"A key question concerns the extent to which sexual differentiation of human behavior is influenced by sex hormones present during sensitive periods of development (organizational effects), as occurs in other mammalian species. The most important sensitive period has been considered to be prenatal, but there is increasing attention to puberty as another organizational period, with the possibility of decreasing sensitivity to sex hormones across the pubertal transition. In this paper, we review evidence that sex hormones present during the prenatal and pubertal periods produce permanent changes to behavior. There is good evidence that exposure to high levels of androgens during prenatal development results in masculinization of activity and occupational interests, sexual orientation, and some spatial abilities; prenatal androgens have a smaller effect on gender identity, and there is insufficient information about androgen effects on sex-linked behavior problems. There is little good evidence regarding long-lasting behavioral effects of pubertal hormones, but there is some suggestion that they influence gender identity and perhaps some sex-linked forms of psychopathology, and there are many opportunities to study this issue.

The encephaloclastic characteristics of the cyst indicated that it was acquired between the 22nd and 24th gestational weeks, after the major waves of neuronal migration had tapered off. The cyst destroyed the left temporal and occipital lobes, and the inferior parietal lobule. Surprisingly, MS had no evidence of aphasia, alexia, agraphia, or ideational apraxia; in contrast, cognitive functions dependent on the integrity of the right hemisphere were severely impaired. To test the hypothesis that the development of language in MS took place at the expense of functions that are normally carried out by the right hemisphere, we investigated MS's correlates of oral comprehension with fMRI as a proxy for auditory comprehension and other cognitive functions strongly lateralized to the posterior left hemisphere, such as ideational praxis and reading. Comprehension of spoken language engaged the homologous of Wernicke's area in the right planum temporale. Porencephaly may represent a natural model of neuroplasticity supervening at predictable epochs of prenatal development."

The authors examined whole body semiserial paraffin sections of a female fetus (155 mm CRL; similar to 18 weeks of gestation), with a particular focus on the head region. Cranial autonomic ganglia, nasal olfactory cells, and the orbital muscle were investigated using immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, vasoactive intestinal peptide, calretinin, and smooth muscle actin expression. The surface gross anatomy of the fetus appeared normal. The left eyeball lacked a lens (the eyeballs were otherwise normal). The orbital muscle was very thick and located in the anterolateral side of the extraocular muscles. Conversely, the extraocular muscles made a cluster in the superoposterior side of the orbit. The infratemporal fossa was small due to the bulky, transversely extended lateral pterygoid process in contrast to the small coronoid process of the mandible. The bilateral mandibular bases overlapped at the midline symphysis. The thin orbitosphenoid and thick alisphenoid provided an almost flat, anterior cranial base. Nasal olfactory cells and cranial autonomic ganglia appeared to be normal. No major anomaly was observed in the brain. Because of the changes in topographical anatomy, the orbital muscle probably lost its normal bony attachment and appeared to push the extraocular muscles superoposteriorly. A gene function redundancy rather than mutation may explain the present restricted anomalies in the mandible and pterygoid process. Clin. Anat. 24:599-606, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Recent neuroimaging studies have increasingly identified such impairments in patients with ASD, including alterations in sensory systems. However, the cellular substrates and molecular underpinnings of disrupted connectivity remain poorly understood. Utilizing eye-specific segregation in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) as a model system, we investigated the formation and refinement of precise patterning of synaptic connections in the BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mouse model of ASD. We found that at the neonatal stage, the shape of the dLGN occupied by retinal afferents was altered in the BTBR group compared to C57BL/6J (B6) animals. Notably, the degree of overlap between the ipsi- and contralateral afferents was significantly greater in the BTBR mice. Moreover, these abnormalities continued into mature stage in the BTBR animals, suggesting persistent deficits rather than delayed maturation of axonal refinement. Together, these results indicate disrupted connectivity at the synaptic patterning level in the BTBR mice, suggesting that in general, altered neural circuitry may contribute to autistic behaviours seen in this animal model. In addition, these data are consistent with the notion that lower-level, primary processing mechanisms contribute to altered visual perception in ASD. Autism Res2017, 10: 212-223.

This article compares descriptions of important factors for initiating and maintaining positive changes among male and female clients treated for alcohol and/or drug problems. The results have a bearing both on substance use treatment and on other areas in social work practice where these problems are encountered. Studies highlighting gender perspective indicate differences regarding experience of alcohol and drug problems and treatment. An advantage of the study is the qualitative analysis of a rather comprehensive material (n=90) enabling more general conclusions than in previous research with a limited number of clients. Findings: Women more often than men stress poor mental health and their children as important for initiating change. When referring to partners, women report abusive rather than supportive partners while the opposite applies to men. For maintaining change, male clients more often stress changes in ways of thinking and feeling as important. Men also report becoming more sensitive while women get more active. This can be understood as transcending of gender with possibilities of a broader repertoire of how to act. Applications: A challenge for practical treatment work is to create possibilities for clients to broaden their repertoire of ways of living and thinking about themselves, expressed by women as the importance of taking space and speaking up and by the men of showing emotion and listening more."

Drawing on ethnographic observations of court cases in a Family Court located in the northeastern United States, this study seeks to understand how judges encourage or inhibit parents' participation and the strategies and tactics used to influence parental behaviors and obtain cooperation with court orders. Findings: On one end of the spectrum are judges who engage little, or not at all with parents, preferring to speak only to the professional court actors. On the other end of the spectrum is a more participatory approach, with judges weaving parents into court room exchanges and engaging them in informational and decision-making dialogs. A similar divergence appears when soliciting cooperation from parents, with some judges relying on shaming rituals and others using a softer approach that incorporates praise and support. Applications: Strategic interventions are identified that will increase parents' cooperation and satisfaction with the Family Court system. These include vigorously engaging in both informational and decision-making dialogs with parents and using rituals of praise and support, rather than shaming."

The social services initiated an examination on the local hospital, but no conclusion regarding the marks was reached. The girl was institutionalized before a forensic examination after three days concluded that the marks were Mongolian spots. The case stresses the importance of being able to distinguish between Mongolian spots and skin hematomas and the need for a genuine clinical forensic examination in cases where child abuse is suspected. A guide for distinguishing between Mongolian spots and skin hematomas is presented."

We aim to estimate the incidence of abuse-related trauma forward medical care and identify its characteristics and clinical course in Taiwan. Patients with trauma between 2005 and 2007 that occurred 3 months before or after a diagnosis of abuse were identified from a randomly sampled nationwide longitudinal health insurance database of 1 million beneficiaries. The patients' demographic data, injury pattern, and medical resource utilization were measured, stratified by age and sex, and compared using chi-square test. Risk factors of next trauma event were identified using Cox regression analysis. Ninety-three patients (65 females) were identified (mean age, 20.6 +/- 16.3 years), including 61.3% under 18 years of age. For the first trauma event, 68 patients (73.1%) visited the emergency room, 63 (67.7%) received intervention, and 14 (15.1%) needed hospital care. Seven (7.5%), all less than 11 years old, had intracranial hemorrhage and required intensive care. Thirty-three (35.5%) left with complications or sequelae, or required rehabilitation, but all survived. Of the 34 victims of sexual abuse, 32 were aged less than 18 years. Men received more mood stabilizers or antipsychotics (50.0% vs 10.7%, P = 0.030) and reeducative psychotherapy (25.0% vs 0, P = 0.044). Risk factors for a next trauma event were injury involving the extremities (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.27 [2.45-11.33]) and use of antibiotics (HR: 4.21 [1.45-12.24]) on the first trauma event. Abuse-related trauma has heterogeneous presentations among subgroups. Clinicians should be alert in providing timely diagnosis and individualized intervention."
1790,Psychology  , Child abuse  , violence; aggression; definitions; intent; injury        ,"Accurate definitions of phenomena are essential to any scientific enterprise. A definition of violence should be fully capable of accounting for the exclusion of behaviors such as accidents and self-defense, and the inclusion of behaviors such as child abuse, sexual offenses, and manslaughter. Violence research has produced numerous and sometimes conflicting definitions of violence that can be organized into 4 general camps: the exemplars approach, the social psychology approach, the public health approach, and the animal research approach. Each approach has strengths and limitations, but to fully distinguish violence from other behaviors requires incorporating elements from all of them. A comprehensive definition of violence includes 4 essential elements: behavior that is (a) intentional, (b) unwanted, (c) nonessential, and (d) harmful. More sophisticated recognition of some elements is needed. For example, shortened telomeres-a known consequence of child abuse-is a far more serious harm than a scratch or bruise that will fully heal in a few days. Many problems in the field are due at least in part to insufficient attention to definitions, such as minimization of sexual violence, bullying, and other behaviors that do not map onto prototypical exemplars. More precise definitions of violence can improve surveillance, promote more accurate identification of causes and consequences, enhance evaluation of treatment outcomes, and guide development of prevention programs, among other benefits."
1590,Psychology  , Gender roles  , MOOCs; STEM; learning analytics; empirical study; gender diversity; lifelong learning        ,"A very high number of learners take part in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) anywhere and at any time. Some researchers give a broad overview about typical learners in MOOCs, but many questions about social, cultural and ethical dimensions of eLearning are not answered yet. Notwithstanding the above, there are a lot of worldwide initiatives for supporting girls and women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Nevertheless in some countries, especially in Western Europe, we are still far away from gender parity in STEM. In line with these two aspects this paper focuses on 100.000 learners from more than 190 countries (data collected since 2012 and enhanced with survey data) who take part in MOOCs on computer sciences offered by the online learning platform ""openHPI"". Our primary interest concerns to the following research questions from a sociological point of view: Who takes part in STEM-MOOCs (selectivity)? Which factors influence the successful participation of men and women in STEM-MOOCs and under which conditions are MOOCs able to promote gender diversity in STEM (e.g. second-chance education and re-entry into the labor market)? The aim of this paper is to raise the potential of MOOCs to educate underrepresented groups in specific fields like women in STEM by analyzing the learning behavior of different kinds of people and giving recommendations for further MOOC offers. Therefore we analyze eLearning in MOOCs in regard of the following social, cultural and ethical dimensions: o age, gender, socio-demographic background, subject field, working experience, social interaction among students (in the forum and in learning groups) and between students and teachers/tutors; o country of residence, values, gender roles; o fairness (e.g. in behalf of peer assessment) and conformity with regulations (e.g. concerning the communication via the forum). We report new results of our multivariate statistics and give recommendations for attracting more women to take part in STEM-MOOCs, e.g. with regard to the role of teachers, course design, learning materials, examples and speech geared to a diverse target group and a suitable learning environment for a very heterogeneous group of learners."
1729,Psychology  , Gender roles  , divorce; gender roles; parenting; parental alienation; stereotypes        ,"According to gender role theory, individuals who confirm expectations associated with their gender roles are rewarded and judged against these expectations when they deviate. Parental roles are strongly tied to gender, and there are very different expectations for behaviors of mothers and fathers. This study examined how mothers' and fathers' behaviors that support or discourage a positive relationship with the other parent are perceived in terms of their acceptability. Two-hundred twent-eight parents completed an online survey assessing perceptions of acceptability of negative ( parental alienating) and positive coparenting behaviors. Results provided support for our hypothesis: Although parental alienating behaviors were rated unacceptable, they were more acceptable for mothers than fathers. Expectancy violation theory can explain why parental alienating behaviors are not viewed as negatively when mothers exhibit them than fathers."

The aim of the study was to assess the extent to which adolescents portray themselves according to gender stereotypes on their Facebook profiles. Participants were 623 Facebook users of both sexes who responded to the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the Personal Well-being Index (PWI). In the first step, the adolescents responded to the BSRI with respect to how they view a typical adult in terms of gender stereotypes. In the second step, half of them responded to the BSRI with respect to how they view themselves and the other half responded with respect to their self-presentation on Facebook. The results show that adolescents consider themselves to be less sexually differentiated than a typical adult of their own sex, both in their self-perception and their self-portrayal on Facebook. The study confirms that the psychological well-being of girls decreases considerably with age and that it is associated with a greater degree of masculinity. We conclude that adolescents produce accurate self-representations on their Facebook profiles, and both boys and girls tend to offer a less sexually differentiated self-concept and self-portrayal than that of the typical adult, with a slight preference for masculine traits; moreover, masculinity is associated with a greater degree of psychological well-being."

This study aimed to identify approaches to empowering African American men as proactive participants in prostate cancer decision making using an established community-campus partnership employing elements of community-based participatory research methods. Community stakeholders with an interest in, and knowledge about, health care in two local African American communities were recruited and completed key informant interviews (N = 39). Grounded theory coding identified common themes related to prostate cancer knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and responses to them. Common barriers such as gender roles, fear, and fatalism were identified as barriers to work-up and treatment, and both communities' inadequate and inaccurate prostate cancer information described as the key problem. To build on community strengths, participants said the change must come from inside these communities, not be imposed from the outside. To accomplish this, they suggested reaching men through women, connecting men to doctors they can trust, making men's cancer education part of broader health education initiatives designed as fun and inexpensive family entertainment events, and having churches bring community members in to speak on their experiences with cancer. This study demonstrated the success of community engagement to identify not only barriers but also local strengths and facilitators to prostate cancer care in two suburban/rural African American communities. Building collaboratively on community strengths may improve prostate cancer care specifically and health care in general."
2200,Psychology  , Gender roles  , Gender; German colonialism; German Southwest Africa; race; biography; colonial law        ,"Agnes Hill, the unmarried daughter of a British landowner and farmer and his mixed-race wife, was living a white' farmer's life in the colony German South West Africa. In 1908, she was suddenly classified as native', due to the enforcement of radical racial legislation in the German colony degrading the offspring of mixed-race people as bastards'. The new classification would have had dire consequences for the whole family, especially in respect to their landownership. However, Agnes fought for her family, with the support of solicitors and - as a daughter of a British father coming from the Cape Colony - with the help of the British consul residing in the German colony. She finally succeeded in securing the estate for the family, even if she was an unmarried woman in a predominantly patriarchal settler society. Using mainly material from the court cases, the article traces Agnes Hill's fight for the Hill inheritance, thereby investigating various crucial issues of colonial societies. It points at the changing boundaries between white' and non-white' and the ambiguity of racial classifications. The article argues that women such as Agnes Hill could play a significant role in colonial settler societies and were able to transcend gender-role boundaries."

Participants completed a contextually controlled interrelated conditional discrimination training procedure (match to sample) without tests of symmetry or transitivity. Study list words were nominally assigned to participate in a functional equivalence class with 1 set of non-study words in 1 context but with a different set of non-study words in a different context. The study list words were then presented in 1 of the 2 contexts, between subjects, for free-recall memory testing. Subsequent transfer of the study list words' remembering function to non-study words (i.e., false recall) was found to be partially dependent upon the context in which the free recall test was administered, thus demonstrating partial contextual control of semantic false memory."
1069,Psychology  , False memories  , overconfidence; cognitive bias; delusions; psychosis; schizophrenia        ,"A number of recent studies have identified an ""overconfidence effect"" in psychosis, whereby people with schizophrenia are overconfident in errors while simultaneously slightly underconfident when accurate. This effect may have implications for why delusions, which are based on inaccurate inferences, perceptions and judgements, are typically held with high conviction. Given the importance the overconfidence effect may have in accounting for delusional conviction, the current narrative review aims to summarise and critique the recent evidence for the effect within schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia were consistently found to be overconfident in errors and slightly underconfident in correct appraisals, and this effect appears not to be an artefact of poor task performance. While the overconfidence effect has been linked to delusion-proneness in the general population, there was less direct evidence linking overconfidence to delusional symptoms in clinical populations. Future studies need to adopt longitudinal designs and include additional measures of overconfidence to investigate this association more appropriately, and to also investigate possible mediators of this postulated relationship, such as dopaminergic activity."
1679,Psychology  , False memories  , working memory capacity; individual differences; hindsight bias; misinformation effects        ,"ABSTRACT. The present study examined individual differences in susceptibility to two similar forms of memory distortion: the misinformation effect and hindsight bias. The misinformation effect occurs when individuals witness an event, are provided with misinformation, and recall the original event as containing elements of the misinformation. Hindsight bias occurs when individuals make judgments, are provided with feedback, and recall their original judgments as being more similar to the feedback than they actually were. Seventy-five participants completed a misinformation task, a hindsight bias task, and several individual difference measures related to memory distortions. Working memory capacity was negatively correlated with the misinformation effect and hindsight bias, and the misinformation effect and hindsight bias were negatively correlated with one another. Although the misinformation effect and hindsight bias are measured with similar designs, and both are predicted by working memory capacity, the negative correlation between them suggests these phenomena result from somewhat different processes."
1734,Psychology  , False memories  , Eyewitness testimony; false memory; post-event misinformation; semantic category        ,"According to one of the most prominent false memory theories (Fuzzy Trace Theory), false memories stem from the semantic association between the original information and post-event misinformation. Furthermore, the strength of this association predicts the probability of accepting the post-event misinformation as original information. In order to test this prediction within the eyewitness testimony framework, the current study used a video of a mock-theft and a narrative of the event in which some original information was changed as post-event misinformation. To that end, the strong and the weak members of the category to which original information belongs to, and semantically unrelated options were given as distractors in addition to the original information in a recognition test. Analysis revealed that semantically strong and weak distractors were significantly more likely to be accepted as original information than the semantically unrelated item. Semantically strong distractors were accepted as original information more than weak distractors, although the difference did not reach significance. Findings were discussed in terms of Fuzzy Trace Theory and the ""developmental reversals"" approach by Brainerd and Reyna (2012)."

Therefore, the problems inherent in children serving as witnesses are crucial. In preschool-aged children, false memories may be identified because of misinformation and insight bias. Additionally, they are susceptible of suggestions. The aim of this study was to verify the levels of suggestibility in children between three and 5 years of age. Ninety-two children were examined (44 male, 48 female; M = 4.5 years, SD = 9.62). We used the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) and the averages variance by SPSS statistical program. The results concluded that: younger children are almost always more susceptible to suggestibility. The dimension of immediate recall was negatively correlates with that of total suggestibility (r = -0.357 p < 0.001). Social compliance and source monitoring errors contribute to patterns of suggestibility, because older children shift their answers more often (r = 0.394 p < 0.001). Younger children change their answers more times (r = -0.395 p < 0.001)."

Our research is focused on educational/instructional design for students' learning. In this sub-field, progress has been more limited. In particular, neither research nor systems development have paid much attention to the fact that design is becoming a more collaborative endeavor. This paper reports the latest research outcomes from R&D in the Educational Design Studio (EDS), a facility developed iteratively over four years to support and understand collaborative, real-time, co-present design work. The EDS serves to (i) enhance our scientific understanding of design processes and design cognition and (ii) provide insights into how designers' work can be improved through appropriate technological support. In the study presented here, we introduced a complex, multi-user, digital design tool into the existing ecology of tools and resources available in the EDS. We analysed the activity of four pairs of 'teacher-designers' during a design task. We identified different behaviors - in reconfiguring the task, the working methods and toolset usage. Our data provide new insights about the affordances of different digital and analogue design surfaces used in the Studio. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Here, we developed a cancer-cell specific photosensitizer nano-delivery system by synthesizing protoporphyrin IX (PplX)-conjugated pullulan (P) with reducible disulfide bonds. The amphiphilic P-s-s-PpIX conjugate self-assembled in aqueous condition to form core-shell structured nanoparticles (P-s-s-PpIX NPs) with average size of 166 nm, showing reduction-controllable stability. In in vitro, the photoactivity of P-s-sPpIX NPs in an aqueous environment was significantly suppressed by the self-quenching effect, which kept P-s-s-PpIX NPs in a photo-inactive and quenched state. But in the presence of GSH, P-s-s-P-pIX NPs quickly dissociated by reductive breakage of disulfide linkers, followed by the significant recovery of fluorescent emission and singlet oxygen generation. In MCF-7 cells, compared to non-reducible P-PpIX NPs with stable amide linkages, P-s-s-PpIX NPs displayed higher cytotoxicity and induced higher apoptosis rate of tumor cells with light irradiation treatment. As a result, the P-s-s-PpIX NPs may serve as an effective smart nanomedicine platform for specific light-up and reduction-triggered cancer imaging and photodynamic therapy with the prominently reduced damage to normal tissues and cells.

With growing demand and wider applications of these strengthening systems, it is their durability that has recently received significant attention from the research community, largely in the form of laboratory testing of deteriorated FRP-to-concrete joints. To develop generalized deterioration factors, a database of shear tests has been collected to quantitatively assess the change in bond characteristics across a number of environmental conditions. It has been identified that a major shortcoming of existing test data is that reporting of the full-range load-displacement behavior is very limited. To supplement existing data, an experimental study is devised to further assess the deterioration of carbon FRP bonded systems under three aqueous conditions. The investigation consists of continually immersing specimens in water, a 5% salt solution, and, for the first time, a sulfuric acid solution of pH 4.0 to simulate the pooling of acid rain. Results show that sulfuric acid attack is most detrimental to the durability of the bond. Then, using a mechanics-based numerical model, bond properties are extracted from the present results as well those in published literature, to determine conservative deterioration factors for the change in bond characteristics with environmental exposure.

In this review paper, a focus on the relevant state-of-the art on advanced physico-chemical processes- including ozonation, wet oxidation, Fenton's reagent, photocatalysis, coagulation-flocculation, as well as electrochemical, solar-driven and hybrid processes- for the treatment of OMW is presented. In particular, the extent of recalcitrant organic pollutants abatement efficiency and the grade of mineralization achieved by the various treatments available up to today is addressed. Special attention is given to the different configurations and treatment line sequences, some important effect parameters and novel materials for implementation at real industrial scale. The latter includes the latest advances and applications for OMW treatment with biopolymers for coagulation-flocculation, ferromagnetic nanocatalyst for ease of recovery and multiple long-term use, low-cost catalysts, doped nanocatalysts for enhanced sunlight activation, zeolite-based catalysts, mixed and doped electrodes, among others.

Recent studies have revealed that Machiavellians are emotionally detached and that this ""affective blunting"" is associated with intense feelings, emotional instability, negative emotions, and difficulty in enduring distress. We used brain-imaging techniques to investigate emotion regulation in Machiavellianism at a neuropsychological level. We used situations in which participants were required to demonstrate emotional flexibility to explore the controversy surrounding the fact that Machiavellianism is associated with both cold-mindedness and emotional instability. Participants performed a reappraisal task in which emotionally evocative pictures (from the International Affective Picture System) were presented in different contexts (negative, positive, and neutral). They were asked to interpret a scenario according to its title and to reinterpret it according to another context created by a new title (e.g., negatively labeled pictures shifted to positively labeled ones). During task performance, Machiavellians showed increased activation of brain regions associated with emotion generation-for example, the amygdala and insula. This indicates that Machiavellian individuals are able to be involved emotionally in social situations. Increased activation in the temporal and parahippocampal regions during reappraisal suggests that Machiavellians use semantic-perceptual processes to construct alternative interpretations of the same situation and have enhanced memory for emotional stimuli. Furthermore, they seem to possess an intense awareness that leads them to shift attention from external to internal information to detect environmental changes. These cognitive processes may enable them to adjust their behavior quickly. This study supports the flexibility hypothesis of Machiavellianism and suggests that Machiavellians' approach to emotion regulation is linked to their rational mode of thinking."

However, there are still many questions left to answer since efficacy has mainly been shown among upper-middle class patients in English-speaking countries and in controlled studies, with expert professionals guiding the intervention and with a limited number of domains of painful experience evaluated. For this study, a program of multicomponent psychological intervention was implemented: (a) based on techniques with empirical evidence, but developed in Spain; (b) at a public primary care center; (c) among patients with limited financial resources and lower education; (d) by a novice psychologist; and (e) evaluating all domains of painful experience using the instruments recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT). The aim of this study was to evaluate this program. We selected a consecutive sample of 40 patients treated for chronic non-cancer pain at a primary care center in Utrera (Seville, Spain), adults who were not in any employment dispute, not suffering from psychopathology, and not receiving psychological treatment. The patients participated in 10 psychological intervention sessions, one per week, in groups of 13-14 people, which addressed psychoeducation for pain; breathing and relaxation; attention management; cognitive restructuring; problem-solving; emotional management; social skills; life values and goal setting; time organization and behavioral activation; physical exercise promotion; postural and sleep hygiene; and relapse prevention. In addition to the initial assessment, measures were taken after the intervention and at a 6-month follow-up. We assessed the program throughout the process: before, during and after the implementation. Results were analyzed statistically (significance and effect size) and from a clinical perspective (clinical significance according to IMMPACT standards). According to this analysis, the intervention was successful, although improvement tended to decline at follow-up, and the detailed design gave the program assessment a high degree of standardization and specification. Finally, suggestions for improvement are presented for upcoming applications of the program."

Peer-reviewed literature attempts to draw conclusions about adaptive management effectiveness using social perceptions, but those studies are largely restricted to employees of US federal organizations. To gain a more comprehensive insight into perceived adaptive management effectiveness, this study aimed to broaden the suite of disciplines, professional affiliations, and geographic backgrounds represented by both practitioners and scholars. A questionnaire contained a series of questions concerning factors that lead to or inhibit effective management, followed by another set of questions focused on adaptive management. Using a continuum representing strategies of both adaptive management and traditional management, respondents selected those strategies that they perceived as being effective. Overall, characteristics (i.e., strategies, stakeholders, and barriers) identified by respondents as contributing to effective management closely aligned with adaptive management. Responses were correlated to the type of adaptive management experience rather than an individual's discipline, occupational, or regional affiliation. In particular, perceptions of characteristics contributing to adaptive management effectiveness varied between respondents who identified as adaptive management scholars (i.e., no implementation experience) and adaptive management practitioners. Together, these results supported two concepts that make adaptive management effective: practitioners emphasized adaptive management's value as a long-term approach and scholars noted the importance of stakeholder involvement. Even so, more communication between practitioners and scholars regarding adaptive management effectiveness could promote interdisciplinary learning and problem solving for improved resources management."

Stress and coping are related to these outcomes in adolescents with diabetes, yet few studies have examined these constructs longitudinally. This study aimed to describe stress and coping in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and to examine coping strategies as predictors of adolescent adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms, quality of life) and glycemic control. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes completed measures of diabetes-related stress, coping, symptoms of depression, and quality of life at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Data on glycemic control were collected from the adolescents' medical charts. The adolescents' use of primary control coping (e.g., problem solving) and secondary control engagement coping (e.g., positive thinking) strategies predicted significantly fewer problems with quality of life and fewer depressive symptoms over time. In contrast, the use of disengagement coping strategies (e.g., avoidance) predicted more problems with quality of life and depressive symptoms. Coping was not a significant predictor of glycemic control. Coping mediated the effects of diabetes-related stress on depressive symptoms and quality of life. The ways in which adolescents with type 1 diabetes cope with diabetes-related stress predict quality of life and symptoms of depression but not glycemic control. Through the use of screening to identify adolescent's diabetes-related stress and targeted interventions to improve coping strategies, there is potential to improve outcomes."

As we live longer the capacity for cognitive aging increases. Consequently, it has been noted that decline in cognitive performance in the elderly in domains of reasoning, problem solving skills, attention, processing speed, working memory and episodic memory is a significant societal problem. Despite the enormity of this issue there are relatively few interventions for cognitive aging. This may be due to our current state of knowledge on biological factors that underpin cognitive aging. One of the biological contributors to cognitive aging is chronic neuroinflammation. This review will provide an overview of the peripheral and central mechanisms involved in chronic neuroinflammation and how neuroinflammation may be related to age-associated cognitive decline. Plant based extracts including herbal and nutritional supplements with anti-inflammatory properties will be examined in relation to their utility in treating age-related cognitive decline. Plant based extracts in particular offer interesting pharmacological properties that may be quickly utilized to prevent cognitive aging."

Numerous mental processes underline cognition, including attention, producing and understanding language, learning, reasoning, problem solving, decision making and memory formation. In the past, neurones or their parts have been considered to be the exclusive cellular sites of memory and cognitive processes. However, it has become evident that astrocytes, the major homeostatic glial cell of the CNS, provide an essential contribution to memory formation, and astroglial failure may promote cognitive decline in AD. In response to the network reset mechanisms mediated by the noradrenergic projections of neurones located in the locus coeruleus, astrocytes get excited and participate in the morphological remodelling associated with synaptic plasticity, otherwise thought to represent a cellular mechanism of learning and memory. Astroglial morphological plasticity is an energy-demanding process requiring mobilisation of glycogen, which, in the CNS, is almost exclusively stored in astrocytes. Astroglia exhibit cytoplasmic excitability that engages ions (such as Ca2+ and Na+) and second messengers (such as cAMP). These ions/molecules contribute to the reception of extracellular signals and coordinate the secretion of glio-signalling molecules, including peptides such as apolipoporotein E, which participates in lipid transport between glia and neurones. In this setting, astrocytes are positioned as spatio-temporal integrators of neural network coordination, which disintegrates during progression of AD. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Three recombinant beta-mannanases, reAuMan5A, reAuMan5A-F-M and reAuMan5A-R-M, were purified to homogeneity with specific activities of 230.6, 153.3 and 241.7 U/mg. The temperature optimum of reAuMan5A-R-M was 70 degrees C, identical with that of reAuMan5A, while its thermostability and melting temperature (T-m) reached 68 degrees C and 74.9 degrees C, being 8.0 degrees C and 8.4 degrees C higher than those of the latter, respectively. Additionally, the Km values of reAuMan5A-R-M, towards locust bean gum, konjac gum and guar gum, significantly decreased to 0.9, 1.9 and 2.5 mg/mL from 1.7, 3.8 and 4.2 mg/mL of reAuMan5A, while its k(cat)/K-m (catalytic efficiency) values increased to 287.8, 163.7 and 84.4 mL/mg.s from 171.2, 97.6 and 56.0 mL/ing.s of the latter, respectively. These results verified that the fusion of a TmCBM27 into the C-terminus of AuMan5A mediated by (EAAAIC)(3) linker contributed to its improved thermostability and catalytic efficiency.

714,MAE , computer-aided design  , CAD; CAE; stress-strain properties; multifilament twisted yarns; tensile behavior        ,A method is presented for modeling the tensile behavior of multifilament twisted yarns. A filament assembly model and a computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering (CAD/CAE) approach are proposed for the tensile analysis. The geometry of the twisted yarn and the nonlinear filament properties were considered. The finite element method (FEM) and large deformation effects were applied for computation of the stress-extension curves. Ideal yarn structures of five layers with different twist angles were simulated to predict the tensile behavior of each filament and each layer. The stress acting on the filaments after yarn extension could be directly analyzed by the FEM. The stress distribution in the filaments showed that the highest stress regions were located at the filament in the center of the yarn and decreased slightly to the yarn surface. The stress-extensions of the filaments were converted to yarn tensile behavior that is shown in terms of the maximum and average stress-extension curves. The results of this prediction model were compared with the stress-strain curves of high-tenacity rayon yarn and the energy method. The maximum stress-extension curves showed very good agreement with experimental results and are more accurate than those obtained by previous methods.

The moving domain of grooved slipper is transformed into a fixed reference domain by the ALE method, which makes it convenient to take the effects of rotate speed, body force, temperature, and oil viscosity into account. A geometric model to express the complex structure, which covers the orifice of piston and slipper, vented groove and the oil film, is constructed. Corresponding to different oil film thicknesses calculated in light of hydrostatic equilibrium theory and boundary conditions, a set of simulations is conducted in COMSOL to analyze the pump characteristics and effects of geometry (groove width and radius, orifice size) on these characteristics. Furthermore, the mechanics and hydraulics analyses are employed to validate the CFD model, and there is an excellent agreement between simulation and analytical results. The simulation results show that the sealing land radius, orifice size and groove width all dramatically affect the slipper behavior, and an optimum tradeoff among these factors is conducive to optimizing the pump design.

Additionally, the ability to evaluate and or approximate the model efficiently, to allow development of a reasonable level of statistical diagnostics of the mathematical model and the physical system, is of central importance. In this study we report on initial efforts to apply integrated adjoint-based computational analysis and automatic differentiation tools to begin to address these issues.

The reactor was designed to generate 1.67 MWth for a fifteen year operational lifetime, with an electric output of 333 kWe. The core has alternating rows of fuel elements and a breeder blanket, with nineteen coolant channels in the fuel element and a single coolant channel in the breeder blanket. The design uses 15% isotopic enriched U-235 based cermet fuel, and uranium dioxide fuelled blankets. S-CO2 is used as a coolant, which converts the heat generated by the reactor to electricity using a closed Brayton cycle. Cermet fuel is used in the form of hexagonal shaped elements with 19 coolant channels and a zirconium hydride neutron moderator. The reactor uses B4C based control drums for control and safety. ZrC is used as thermal insulator, and ensures that the ZrH moderator does not reach an unacceptably high temperature. The coolant channels have a cladding of tungsten to prevent the release of fission gas from the fuel into the coolant. Beryllium reflectors are used to moderate and reflect neutrons back into the active core. The active core has a bull's eye configuration, in which there are alternate fuel and blanket circular rows. Nuclear reactor modeling, neutronics, and depletion analysis were done using MCNP6. The neutronics analysis found the maximum peaking factor that would occur in the core. This was used to determine the greatest amount of thermal power that the core's fuel elements and breeder blanket would experience. This provided the basis for the thermal hydraulics, which sought to determine the maximum inlet and outlet temperatures of the S-CO2 that could be obtained while also keeping all of the reactor materials within an acceptable temperature range. Maximizing these temperatures would provide the highest performance for a power conversion system. Finding the coolant conditions that kept this section of the core below the maximum permissible temperature would ensure that the rest of the core would also remain within an acceptable temperature limit. Simulations were conducted at the different power levels the fuel element and breeder blanket would generate throughout the reactor's fifteen-year lifecycle.

In this investigation the predominant axial velocity component within a freely expanding wash was studied. The flow fields formed by four propellers, each operating at four power levels (speeds of rotation), were investigated under bollard pull conditions and in the absence of a rudder, within a large free surface tank using Laser Doppler Anemometry. The characteristics of these propellers extended the range over which high accuracy measurements have been previously attempted. Comparison were made to existing methodologies by which a prediction of the magnitudes of the axial velocity can be made, and where deficient modifications to the methodologies have been developed and presented. The jets were found to produce a maximum axial velocity along the initial efflux plane at a location near the blade mid-span. The position and magnitude of the axial velocity was seen to decrease as the jet entrained more flow and transitioned from the zone of flow establishment into the zone of established flow.

This paper reports an experimental work on the analysis of surface roughness and material removal using design of experiment (DOE) method in magnetic abrasive finishing, (MAF) of flat surfaces. Change in surface roughness and material removal were found to increase with an increase in weight percentage of abrasive particles in magnetic abrasive brush, lubricant volume and decrease in working gap. Also, any decrease in the relative size of the abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles would result into an increase of the surface roughness and decrease in material removal. It was observed that the work piece hardness had no considerable effect on the process results. The optimum parameter levels which lead into the best surface finish and highest material removal were also derived from these experimentations. Optimum levels included weight percentage of abrasive particles of 40%, Lubricant volume of 1 ml, working gap of 3 mm, relative size of abrasive particles vis-a-vis the iron particles of 0.22, and work piece hardness of 82-87 HBN.

Conditions for the persistence of the system are obtained which shows that appropriate migration rates facilitate the two competitive populations to cooperate well such that both the populations are persistent in every patch. The results are confirmed by computer simulations. It is also found that the positive equilibrium which is globally stable changes into bitable equilibrium as the parameters vary.

This can be achieved only if the workforce is qualified, skilled and flexible, thus it is clear that an emphasis should also be put on staff development. Development can be achieved in many ways; one of them is through lifelong learning supported by universities. This paper presents e-learning study materials developed by academics in the Department of Machine Design (DMD) at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FME) at the University of West Bohemia (UWB). The study materials focus on design projects from industrial practice. There are several projects and each one focuses on a specific machine. The outputs from all the projects are e-learning pdf files. These study materials contain all the important information which a designer usually comes into contact with, for example: drawing documentation, a 3D model, calculation reports, welding technology, etc. These study materials were developed primarily for full-time students at the Department of Machine Design to rectify their lack of practical knowledge. When the project was completed it became clear that these study materials could also be applied in the context of lifelong learning. The Institute of Lifelong Learning at the University of West Bohemia offers courses and training for companies and the general public. The courses for employees tend to be narrowly focused on an area specified by the company. Public courses are not designed for training individuals. Open courses are periodically arranged in the spring and autumn of each year to train groups. Due to the narrow specialization of engineers who work in industrial practice, there is a loss of continuity in education in other areas of mechanical engineering. The elearning study materials are comprehensive and include knowledge from different fields of engineering. In a new job, these study materials can help an employee to study the problematics before starting work in another field, and possibly even shorten in-company learning.

The effect of the sample diameter and the effective length of the yoke, i.e. yoke depth on H-z are analysed. Experimental results at 1.5 T and 60 H-z showed a reduction of 81 %, 72 % and 30 % by a large magnetizer, shielding and reducing the yoke depth from 80 mm to 10 mm, respectively. This was in comparison to an unshielded compact magnetizer. H-z is also dependent on magnetic loading. Furthermore, at 2 T and 60 Hz, magnetic contributions dominated H-z such that the effectiveness of shielding and reducing the yoke depth decreased to 27 % and 4 %, respectively. To achieve these very high flux densities, the magnetizers were designed to be compact (sample diameter of <= 100 mm and narrow airgaps of <= 2 mm). This reduction in size increases the leakage field above and below the sample to the same level of magnitude as the applied field, which affects the measurement of the magnetic field (H). Two H-coil sizes with a sensitivity difference of 60 % are used to show that the measured H is independent of the coil size, but depends on the leakage field. Their measured core loss difference under pulsating and rotating fields was about 6 %."

Tooth surfaces of the undulating face gear are enveloped by the teeth of a shaper cutter when its pitch circle rolls on the pitch curve of the undulating face gear without sliding. According to the spatial meshing theory, the mathematical model of the face gear tooth surface is built.

419,MAE , Fluid mechanics  , Mathematical modelling; Computational fluid dynamics; Interfacial rheology; Surfactant; Bubble; Films        ,"A fluid mechanics problem relevant to foam fractionation processes is analysed. Specifically the fluid flow field transporting surfactant from foam Plateau borders (fed with surfactant-rich material) towards comparatively surfactant-lean foam films is considered. The extent to which this surfactant mass transfer is limited by surface viscous effects is studied. Previous work (Vitasari et al.. 2016) made assumptions about the likely flow field along the Plateau border surface. These assumptions suggested that 'high' surface viscosity (measured by a suitable dimensionless parameter) led to strong suppression of the rate of surfactant mass transfer from Plateau border to film, whereas 'low' surface viscosity did not suppress this mass transfer rate in any significant way. More detailed fluid mechanical calculations which are carried out here corroborate the aforementioned assumptions in the 'high' surface viscosity regime. However the calculations suggest that in the low' surface viscosity regime, in contrast to the findings from the previous assumptions, moderate reductions in the rate of surfactant mass transfer are also possible. Counterintuitively these moderate reductions in mass transfer rate potentially have more negative impact on fractionation processes than the aforementioned strong suppression. This is because they tend to arise under conditions for which the efficiency of the fractionation system is particularly sensitive to any reduction whatsoever in the surfactant mass transfer rate.

The CCHP system is primarily composed of a biomass gasification sub-system, solar evacuated collector, internal combustion engine and dual-source powered mixed-effect absorption chiller. The product gas produced by the gasifier drives the internal combustion engine to generate power, and the waste heat after generation is utilized to produce cooling and heating with the collected heat from the solar collectors. Under the design conditions, the thermodynamic performances under variable external conditions and energy ratios are investigated and analyzed. The results indicate that the primary energy ratio and the exergy efficiency are 57.9% and 16.1%, respectively, and the carbon emission reduction ratio is about 95.7%, at the design condition. The complementarity analysis between the biomass and solar energy shows that the biomass subsystem makes a greater contribution to the total system primary energy ratio and exergy efficiency than the contributions from the solar subsystem, and the participation of solar energy is conducive to the system emission reduction.

The objectives of this work were to design and assess a hybrid energy system including the removal of the alternators from the tractor and the modification of the agricultural implements to replace the PTO power with electric power, using small pumps and small fans. These changes improved energy use and reduced the atmospheric pollution emission from the internal combustion engine. The hybrid energy system used the original combustion engine of the tractor in combination with a new electrical energy system, which consisted of a hydrogen fuel cell.

In the method, a system optimization is included that ensures that each concept is evaluated with the optimal setup of component sizes, within the boundary conditions set by machine performance requirements.

The interaction between the gravel pile and bucket is also considered, in order to simulate, and optimize, the complete work cycle. A wheel loader in a bucket application, performing a ""short loading cycle"" as part of a production chain is used as an example. This is a common application for larger wheel loaders, hence an important application to optimize for. The main result is that the method and algorithms presented in this paper works. Additional results show that a parallel hybrid wheel loader has approximately 5% higher fuel efficiency and a series hybrid approximately 23% higher comparing to the conventional machine, in the investigated application. The system optimization shows that for example a correctly sized genset, internal combustion engine and electrical machine, in a series hybrid can improve the fuel efficiency approximately 6%, in this application. The comparison is between the optimal downsized genset and a genset in the same size as the internal combustion engine in a conventional machine. The method presented can also be used in other complex machines, such as; agriculture, forestry and road vehicles."

The model takes into account the specific action of the two involved enzymes SST and FFT. In principle, inulin biosynthesis can thus be described as a thermodynamically stabilizing process leading into a stable nodal sink over time. In the initial phases of the reaction, oscillation of sucrose and 1-kestose concentration is observed, dampening rapidly for both products into a stable steady state condition. Applying the same boundary conditions, a higher number average degree of polymerization will lead to a higher frequency and amplitude in oscillation."

The framework provides a general way to constrain possible departures from perfect independence of classical world lines, associated with Planck scale bounds on positional information. A parameterized candidate set of possible correlation functions is shown to be consistent with the known causal structure of the classical geometry measured by an apparatus, and the holographic scaling of information suggested by gravity. Frequency-domain power spectra are derived that can be compared with interferometer data. Simple projections of sensitivity for realistic experimental set-ups suggests that measurements will confirm or rule out a class of Planck scale departures from classical geometry."

The thermodynamic model of the NH3-CO2-SO2-K2SO4-H2O system for the combined CO2 and SO2 capture process was developed and validated in this work to analyze the heat of CO2 and SO2 absorption in the NH3-CO2-SO2-H2O system, and the K2SO4 precipitation characteristics in the NH3-CO2-SO2-K2SO4-H2O system. The average heat of CO2 absorption in the NH3-CO2-H2O system at 40 degrees C is around -73 kJ/mol CO2 in 2.5 wt% NH3 with CO2 loading between 0.2 and 0.5 C/N. The average heat of SO2 absorption in the NH3-SO2-H2O system at 40 degrees C is around -120 kJ/mol SO2 in 2.5 wt% NH3 with SO2 loading between 0 and 0.5 S/N. The average heat of CO2 absorption in the NH3-CO2-SO2-H2O system at 40 degrees C is 77, 68, and 58 kJ/mol CO2 in 2.5 wt% NH3 with CO2 loading between 0.2 and 0.5 C/N, when SO2 loading is 0, 0.1, 0.2 S/N, respectively. The solubility of K2SO4 increases with temperature, CO2 and SO2 loadings, but decreases with NH3 concentration in the CO2 and SO2 loaded aqueous NH3. The thermodynamic evaluation indicates that the combined CO2 and SO2 capture process could employ the typical absorption/regeneration process to simultaneously capture CO2 and SO2 in an absorber, thermally desorb CO2 in a stripper, and feasibly remove sulfite (oxidized to sulfate) content by precipitating K2SO4 from the lean NH3 solvent after the lean/rich heat exchanger.

In this study, we isolated a novel bacterium capable of producing cellulose from waste glycerol, and identified it as a novel strain (named NEDO-01) of Gluconacetobacter intermedius. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the morphology of the pellicle produced by NEDO-01 was similar to that of cellulose produced by Gluconacetobacter hansenii ATCC23769. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses suggested that cellulose produced by NEDO-01 had molecular and crystalline structures similar to those of cellulose produced by ATCC23769. After the optimization of cultivation conditions, NEDO-01 mediated the one-step production of nanofibrillated bacterial cellulose (NFBC) from waste glycerol in a medium supplemented with carboxymethyl cellulose. Transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that the NFBC was composed of relatively uniform fibers with diameters of approximately 20 nm. NFBC was produced as uniform water suspensions, the yield of which was 3.4 g/L from cultivation in 7.5 L medium in a 10-L jar fermenter. The bioconversion of waste glycerol to NFBC, which has superior fluidity, moldability, and miscibility, has a wide variety of applications, including potential uses in the medical and materials engineering fields."

Here we present the CdSe-CdS tetrapod quantum dot, incorporated into polymer matrices via electrospinning, as an in situ luminescent stress probe for the mechanical properties of polymer fibers. The mechanooptical sensing performance is enhanced with increasing nanocrystal concentration while causing minimal change in the mechanical properties even up to 20 wt % incorporation. The tetrapod nanoprobe is elastic and recoverable and undergoes no permanent change in sensing ability even upon many cycles of loading to failure. Direct comparisons to side-by-side traditional mechanical tests further validate the tetrapod as a luminescent stress probe.

MET improves project design by providing an economic perspective to the traditional materials science tetrahedron, relating microstructure, processing, property, and performance through the introduction of value-based economic costs for each side of the tetrahedron. The resulting size and distortion, from a regular tetrahedron illustrates the balance between the system, component, or material fabrication project detailed. The MET model also allows for increased budget efficiency and the potential for improved identification of cost saving mechanisms. The use of financial tools, such MET, will aid engineering project management by providing easy and reliable metrics to compare projected costs versus desired outcomes. Expansion and use of these types of tools will reduce risks during the initial stages of project design. To illustrate the strength of MET, several example tetrahedra were generated demonstrating the various uses and applications of this new program."

A test near the resonance frequency has the advantage that higher stresses can be applied to test specimens at a reduced input power. Stress amplitude up to 1000 MPa can be applied to the test specimens and up to four specimens can be tested simultaneously. The setup can test specimens at high fatigue cycle regime i.e. 100 million stress cycles can be achieved in 48 hours. The setup has been used to study the effects of internal and external microstructure on the fatigue strength of materials. Specimens especially stainless steel-304 was prepared by different techniques i.e. electric discharge machining EDM, etching and laser cutting. Specimens prepared by these techniques were tested and their fatigue strengths were compared. To probe the material endurance limit, tests were also performed on the above mentioned steel specimens in very high stress cycle regime i.e. >10(9) cycles. In order to investigate the effect of internal microstructure on fatigue strength of material, CuZn37 fabricated by etching was tested and the effect of different grain size on fatigue strength was compared. SN curves have been plotted for materials with no prior fatigue strength data. Stainless steel-1.4404 specimens prepared by Rapid Prototyping (RP) has been tested for fatigue analysis. The test results showed higher degree of scattering when compared to the traditionally manufactured steel. Fractography revealed the existence of inherent material flaws which was the main reason of higher degree of test point scattering. In addition to these data, the SN curve was plotted for Innolot which is an important soldering alloy and prompts to fatigue failure in electronic assemblies."

Previous models are generalized here in three aspects: the cumulative damage model is more general and can include damage functions other than the additive and multiplicative damages; the strength reduction function due to initial damage existing in the material is taken to be a very general function; and the initial damage process is a more general stochastic process that includes those previously assumed as special cases. The approach taken here is therefore the most general cumulative damage model obtained to date and yields a large number of potentially more useful accelerated test models for material strength. Estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood methods is discussed, and two examples using real tensile strength data for carbon micro-composites and single carbon fibers are presented, illustrating the improvement of the new approach over previous models.

However, for modeling the problems of fatigue strength durability of textile materials, probabilistic models based on Weibull's theory and those based on the log-normal distribution seem to be most useful.

People with ABI demand solutions in research that offer them with a relearning process such that they can recover not only their physical skills but also their cognitive abilities. In this context, the inherent characteristics of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), transparency and intelligence, have turned it into one of the best approaches to square up to the impairment that ABI can cause. As AmI proposes the development of context-aware systems that integrate different devices to recognize the context and act accordingly, these systems can react promptly to the needs of people with ABI while they carry out their rehabilitation process. Moreover, the explbitation of a Multi-Agent architecture emerges as a natural solution to develop AmI systems, since agents are reactive, proactive and exhibit an intelligent and autonomous behavior. Therefore, in this paper, a Multi-Agent architecture (MAS) for healthcare Aml systems is presented. It contributes to treat people with ABI by using specific devices to control the patient's movements and some physiological responses, such as the variation of the heart rate, during her rehabilitation process. In this way, the natural relationship between AmI and MAS is exploited. Finally, how this system is used to both design and execute therapies for people with ABI is presented."

Much of the documented research in this area has in the main focused on recognition across pre-segmented sensor data.

In this paper, slurry-settlement, constant head permeability, and seepage-force tests were conducted to determine the geocontainers' geotechnical design parameters. The characteristics of the dredged fill material determined from the slurry-settlement, constant head permeability, and seepage-force tests are presented. Large-scale tests on model geotextile tubes were also conducted. A large-scale apparatus for geotextile tube-filling test simulation is introduced.

These sludges are hard to dewater because of their high clay content and their low hydraulic conductivity. This paper describes pressure filtration tests in which eight different nonwoven geotextiles (GTXs) were used to filter high-clay-content sludges. The sludges were formulated by mixing kaolinite and silt to obtain eight different grain-size distributions (GSDs) with d(50) ranging from 3 to 55 mu m and clay content ranging from 0% to 38% (d < 2 mu m). The sludges created for this research had the GSD and variability of real fine tailings. The results indicate that sludges can be filtered with nonwoven GTXs selected on the basis of their pore-opening size. Furthermore, calendered GTXs are more efficient in retaining particles than needle punched GTXs. In addition, only during the early stage of filtration do GTXs really influence filtering because it is at this stage that, by retaining coarser particles, they allow progressive formation of filter cake. Upon forming, the filter cake becomes the major contributor to particle retention. Finally, the sludge composition is found to be the most significant factor affecting the final state of dewatering.

Mulch treatments were applied at planting: 1) weed mat (geotextile), 2) Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) sawdust, and 3) compost + sawdust (compost applied to soil, then covered with sawdust). This paper addresses mulch treatment effects on soil and plant nutrient status during the first two years of the trial, and the first berry harvest in year 2 (2008). Yard-debris compost used in the field experiment had a pH of 7.3 and low soluble salt (EC <1 mS/cm). The yard debris compost + sawdust treatment produced greater berry yields than sawdust alone in the first bearing season. Relative berry yields were 100% for weedmat, 90% for sawdust + compost, and 70% for sawdust mulch. The positive effects of compost on berry yield were observed across two cultivars, flat or raised beds, and for two organic fertilizer sources (fish emulsion or feather meal) applied at two rates (29 and 57 kg .ha(-1) N). Soil pH underlying the mulch was lowest (most acidic) with weed mat and highest under sawdust + compost mulch. After two years, compost increased soil organic matter (OM; 0-20 cm) by 9 g .kg(-1) vs. weedmat, while sawdust mulch did not increase soil OM. In summary, compost maintained soil pH in the optimum range for blueberry, provided plant-available cations, increased soil organic matter, and increased berry yield (relative to sawdust alone). The mechanism(s) behind the compost benefit deserve further investigation."

In this paper, a closed-form solution was derived for a direct determination of the cross-section of geosynthetic mattress. Laboratory large scale model tests were also carried out to verify the proposed analytical method. The cross-sections of the geosynthetic mattresses obtained from the closed-form solutions agreed well with the data obtained from model tests.

Measurements were done with the aircraft on several days with varying wind and weather conditions, while the focus of the study is on the characterisation of the flow field in main wind direction and neutral stratification. It is shown that flow inclination of up to 30 is found over the escarpment, but attenuates within a few hundred metres downstream. The formation of a reattached boundary layer could be measured, as well as an increased turbulence intensity in the reattachment zone.

Images from both Terra and Aqua platforms of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor were used for ET estimation by employing the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. As a part of the accuracy assessment process, in-situ measurements on soil temperature and reference ET (ET0) were recorded at the time of satellite overpass. In order to enhance the accuracy of the generated ET maps, MODIS images were subjected to sub-pixel analysis by assigning weights for different land surface cover (urban, agriculture and multi-surface areas) reflections. The weighting process was achieved by integrating ET from pure pixels with the respective site-specific ET0 of each land cover. The enhanced SEBAL model estimated ET exhibited a good correlation with the in-situ measured Penman-Montieth ET0, with R-2 values for the Aqua and the Terra platforms of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. However, the correlation of the non-enhanced ET maps resulted in R-2 values of 0.61 and 0.68 for the Aqua and the Terra platforms, respectively. Hence, the results of this study revealed the feasibility of employing the sub-pixel analysis method for an accurate estimation of ET over large areas."

First, a regional geomorphological map based on field surveys, remote sensing and previous environmental studies was developed. Then, the well data were analyzed in relation to rainfall, streamflow, yield and pumpage, and the data were interpolated using geostatistical techniques. The results were analyzed via integrated zoning based on color theory as applied to multivariate visualization. The analysis results indicate areas that would be more suitable for groundwater extraction in a conjunctive management framework with regard to the natural hydrogeological processes and the effects of human interaction. The kriging results were compared with the geomorphological map, and the geomorphological areas exhibit distinct hydrogeological patterns. The western fans exhibit the best potential for the expansion of conjunctive use, whereas the borders of the northern fans exhibit the lowest potential."

For instance, case study 1 (Puerto Rico, Northeastern Caribbean Sea) has shown an coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98 and an Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.61 m, case study 2 (Iwate, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.94 and an RMSE of 1.50 m, and case study 3 (Miyagi, Japan) has shown an R-2 of 0.93 and an RMSE of 1.65 m. The reference depths were acquired by using LiDAR for case study 1 and an echo-sounder for case studies 2 and 3. Further, the estimated SDB has been used as one of the inputs for the Australian National University and Geoscience Australia (ANUGA) tsunami simulation model. The tsunami simulation results also show close agreement with post-tsunami survey data. The i.mage.bathymetry module developed as a part of this study is made available as an extension for the Open Source GRASS GIS to facilitate wide use and future improvements."
1096,Civil , Rainwater Harvesting  , stormwater harvesting; micro-watershed; sustainable use; evapotranspiration; infiltration trenches        ,"A passive rainwater harvesting technique was used to design a sustainable landscape for a residential lot located in the desert. The design was adapted to the Desert Southwest region of the United States based on thirty years of daily historical climate data including precipitation and reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Four cities including El Paso, TX, Albuquerque, NM, Phoenix, AZ, and Pahrump, NV, were selected to represent the area. The residential lot was broken up into micro-watersheds reflecting the runoff of water from each separate portion of the house roof, driveway, and lawn area. The paper explains in detail the design steps for one of the micro-watersheds where water retention and infiltration structures were distributed throughout the soil area to capture stormwater runoff close to its source. A passive rainwater capture landscape was obtained by using the stormwater captured in the infiltration structures and stored in the surrounding soil. Native vegetation (shrubs and trees) will use this water exclusively for growth. These plants will not require watering once their root establishment period has passed, except in extreme droughts. Meanwhile, stormwater discharge from the lot will decrease and the groundwater recharge will increase. Results indicate that the current urban water budget can be made sustainable by replacing watering of landscape by municipal water with harvested stormwater. This results in a relatively lush and shady environment even in desert climates. The success is an artifact of the tendency of urban watersheds to increase the volume of stormwater relative to pre-development conditions."
1210,Civil , Rainwater Harvesting  , Rainwater harvesting system; Demand fraction; Low demanding application; RHS efficiency; Probability of RHS failure        ,"A rainwater harvesting system (RHS) was designed for a waste treatment facility located near the town of Mirandela (northern Portugal), to be used in the washing of vehicles and other equipment, the cleaning of outside concrete or asphalt floors, and the watering of green areas. Water tank volumes representing 100% efficiency (V-r) were calculated by the Ripple method with different results depending on two consumption scenarios adopted for irrigation. The RHS design was based on a precipitation record spanning a rather long period (3 decades). The calculated storage capacities fulfilled the water demand even when prolonged droughts occurred during that timeframe. However, because the drought events have been rather scarce the V-r values were considered oversized and replaced by optimal volumes. Notwithstanding the new volumes were solely half of the original V-r values, the projected RHS efficiency remained very high (around 90%) while the probability of system failure (efficiency < 100%) stayed very low (in the order of 5%). In both scenarios, the economic savings related to the optimization of V-r were noteworthy, while the investment's return periods decreased substantially from the original to the optimized solutions. A high efficiency with a low storage capacity is typical of low demanding applications of rainwater harvesting, where water availability (V-w) largely exceeds water demand (C-w), that is to say where demand fractions (C-w/V-w) are very low. Based on the results of a literature review covering an ample geographic distribution and describing a very large number of demand fraction scenarios, a C-w/V-w = 0.8 was defined as the threshold to generally distinguish the low from the high demanding RHS applications.

In contrast to the many poorly functioning, community managed rainwater harvesting programs, the individual or decentralized rainwater harvesting structures have led to significant improvements in availability of irrigation water, a revival of the agricultural economy of the region, and substantial increases in farmer incomes and livelihoods. Since 2006, more than 6000 farmers in the state have invested in on-farm ponds. The investments are highly cost effective and farmers are able to recover their initial investment in approximately 3 years. While longer-terms impact studies are needed, this initial assessment suggests that on-farm rainwater harvesting ponds are a promising private small irrigation option in Madhya Pradesh and similar regions in India and elsewhere.

1249,Civil , Rainwater Harvesting  , cluster analysis; dimensionless analysis; domestic rainwater harvesting system (DRWHS); regional level        ,"A regional-level and dimensionless analysis for designing a domestic rainwater harvesting system (DRWHS) was developed. To consider various combinations of water demand, storage capacity, effective roof area, and rainfall in DRWHS design, two dimensionless ratios were used, namely, demand fraction and storage fraction, along with a relationship between the two ratios. Firstly, Northern Taiwan was divided into four sub-regions through cluster analysis based on the average annual 10-day rainfall distribution at rainfall stations and administrative districts. Easy-to-use dimensionless curves between demand fraction and storage fraction were obtained for five rainwater supply reliabilities of the DRWHS for the four sub-regions. Based on the dimensionless curves, a nomogram was constructed for designing DRWHSs at a rainwater supply reliability of 95% in the sub-region I. Storage capacities determined from the dimensionless curves showed a close fit with those determined from simulated values, but were larger than the values estimated from the method presented in the Green Building Evaluation Manual in most situations. The methodology developed herein can be used effectively for the preliminary design of a DRWHS and for overcoming the difficulties faced in designing a DRWHS without rainfall data and with incomplete rainfall data."

The rainfall-runoff threshold value of the RC is the main factor which influences the system efficiency and cost. Antecedent soil moisture condition is an important factor which impacts on the determination of the rainfall-runoff threshold value. In this study, rainfall-antecedent soil moisture condition-runoff relationships and the potential efficiency of RCs are presented. Rainfall and runoff data monitored at research sites in Merredin and Mount Barker are used to determine this relationship. Two antecedent moisture criteria; Antecedent Moisture Conditions (AMC) and Average Antecedent Precipitation (AAP) are used to analyse the relationship between previous rainfall and soil moisture for each RC. Monitored results show that AMC is not that suitable to show the relationship between rainfall and antecedent soil moisture condition of the RC in the dryland of Western Australia and it is recommended to use AAP to determine this relationship."

Comet assay, as a method for detecting DNA alterations, and micronucleus test, as an index of chromosomal damage are the most widely used and authentic methods in laboratory and field studies. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the genotoxic effects of heavy metals generated by toxic industrial effluents and various kinds of pollutants from urban and agricultural areas and domestic waste on Catla catla and Cirrhinus mrigala due to water pollution in the Chenab River, Pakistan. The heavy metals Cd, Cu, Mn. Zn, Pb, Cr, Sn, and Hg were detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometry from water samples collected from predetermined sampling sites. All the physicochemical parameters and heavy metals were found to exceed the upper limits recommended by various agencies. Comet assays showed significant (p < 0.05) DNA damage in C. mrigala compared to C. catla for tail length and olive tail moment from three different sites. Significant (p0.05) findings were observed between fish collected from farmed and non-polluted upstream waters. Micronucleus assays showed similar findings for single and double micronucleus induction in C. catla and C. mrigala. A significantly (p < 0.05) higher micronuclei induction and percent tail DNA was observed in C. mrigala specimen collected from the polluted site. These findings infer that DNA damage could be used as a biomarker of pollution load and its early monitoring by using simple and reliable techniques such as the comet and micronucleus assays, expedient methods for toxicity screening of aquatic environments. Regular monitoring is necessary to assess eco-health of the Chenab River by choosing perhaps C. mrigala, being a bottom feeder, as a bioindicator that could provide more reliable information to determine the status of the environmental quality of the river."

The module is made of a number of DBD tubes that can be arranged in series or parallel. Each of the DBD tubes comprises inner electrode enclosed with dielectric barrier and arranged as such to provide a gap for the passage of gases. Non-thermal plasma generated in the gap effectively creates gaseous chemical reactions. Its efficacy in the remediation of gas stream containing high NOx, similar to diesel emission and wastewater containing latex, are presented. A six tubes DBD module has successfully removed more than 80% of nitric oxide from the gas stream. In another arrangement, oxygen was fed into a two tubes DBD to generate ozone for treatment of wastewater. Samples of wastewater were collected from a treatment pond of a rubber vulcanization pilot plant. The water pollution load was evaluated by the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5) values. Preliminary results showed some improvement (about 13%) on the COD after treatment and at the same time had increased the BOD5 by 42%. This results in higher BOD5/COD ratio after ozonation which indicate better biodegradability of the wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

In the catchment area of the river Swist (Germany), municipal sewage treatment plants were investigated, followed by event-based investigation of combined sewer overflows, rainwater retention basins and diffuse pollution by surface and subsurface run-off as well as drain pipes. Recently, retention soil filters installed between stormwater storage basins and receiving surface waters in order to provide further treatment of combined sewer overflows were investigated. Geographical information system analysis helped to examine the data in their temporal and spatial dimensions. A model for calculating microbial and chemical loads within a catchment area was developed (""Swistbox"") which provides an efficient tool for risk assessment. Nearly two decades of investigation has demonstrated that several elements of the landscape's water balance account for surface water pollution from both diffuse and point sources. Depending on land cover characteristics, wastewater technology and the proportion of wastewater as compared to total river water flow, a source can vary in its importance for the catchment area. The findings can be applied for sustainable and health-sensitive catchment management in relation to recreational or agricultural water use as well as ecological aspects."

However, the DIN sources are poorly constrained. In this study, the contributions of major sources in the Taipei metropolitan area to the DIN export in the Danshui River were investigated. It is observed that ammonium is the major DIN species in the downstream reaches, resulting from the ammonium-dominated inputs of the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and rain water pumping stations (RWPS). DIN concentrations in the downstream (urban) reaches are substantially elevated. The upstream tributaries annually discharge similar to 2709 t DIN to the downstream reaches. However, the DIN discharge off the downstream reaches rises to similar to 17,918 t, resulting from the contribution of RWPS-collected water, i.e., similar to 14,632 t, and the effluents of two WWTP, i.e., similar to 577 t. RWPS-collected water inherently contains the contribution of atmospheric deposition, similar to 2937 t DIN. This finding implies that similar to 11,695 t (similar to 66 % of the downstream output) DIN flux off the Danshui River is from urban runoff and can be attributed to human activities in the Taipei metropolitan area. To improve the water quality in the Danshui River, water quality controls in urban runoff are important."

This system consists of nearly 112 sensors of various types, including four subsystems: automatic data collection subsystem, artificial maintenance management subsystem, early safety warning and comprehensive assessment subsystem, and centralized database management subsystem. The deployments and functions of this structural health monitoring system are first introduced in this paper. Then, a finite-element model updating method, which combines the substructure method with the response surface model updating method, is proposed to reconstruct the actual working state of this suspension bridge in the early safety warning and comprehensive assessment subsystem. In the remaining part, the temperature fields, strain responses, tension forces of the hangers, longitudinal displacements of the stiffening girder, and the meteorological temperature are analyzed. Through the statistical analysis, the relationship between the temperature fields was found; the temperature fields induced strains of the stiffening girder satisfies the linear relationship. The cumulative probability distribution function of the cycle-index of the same daily stress amplitude follows a Weibull distribution. The monitored relative longitudinal displacements of the stiffening girder are linearly related with the meteorological temperatures. The monitored tension forces of the hangers verify the effects of the suspender-free zones of main cables on the normal hangers for this pylongirder detached suspension bridge.

Finally, one cable without the suspended girder and two earth-anchored suspension bridge models are analytically and numerically solved.

Longitudinal restraint stiffness of a double-cable system to the tower was studied in this paper. Two formulas were derived to calculate the longitudinal restraint stiffness of a double-cable system to the tower and the load distribution between the cables, respectively. A mathematical model of a two-span double-cable suspension bridge was created to verify the formulas. The tower-top displacement and the cable force were obtained by formulas, and the results are in good agreement with the results calculated by the FEM. The effects of some important design parameters on longitudinal restraint were studied. Analysis shows that the restraint stiffness increases with the increasing of unit weight of the bridge, dead load distribution to the top cable, sag ratio of the bottom cable, and elastic stiffness of the cables. Effects of tower-top displacement and span length were also analyzed, and some suggestions were given to design a double-cable suspension bridge."

The offered method of measurements is based on the use of slow-wave structures (SWSs), which electrodynamic parameters strongly depend on the electromagnetic properties of the absorbing coatings. The main advantages of the SWS-based measurements are in the possibility to concentrate electromagnetic field in a volume with linear dimensions much smaller the wavelength in free space and to split electric and magnetic fields, providing practically independent monitoring of dielectric and magnetic properties of the coatings. Resonant frequencies and Q-factor of a SWS section placed in parallel to a monitored coating can be used as primary measuring parameters. Analysis of the dispersion equation derived for a SWS-based sensitive element in the presence of a coating allows creating algorithms for converting measured electrodynamic parameters into the reading of the coatings' electromagnetic properties. It is shown also that the use of coupled SWSs leads to the increase in the informative parameters' number and to the significant increase in sensitivity."

578,Civil , Solar Energy  , Natural convection; Radiation interaction; Inclined heatsink; Funnel effect        ,"A hybrid solar energy conversion system described in this study is designed to exceed the efficiency of each type of technology alone by combining advantages of concentrated solar power (CSP) technology and high performance concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) cells. This hybrid system can be tilted at different inclination angles to track the solar power at different latitudes and different time zones. Thermal management is important to CPV cells, as 1000x concentrated solar radiation onto CPV not only leads to higher performance but also generates more waste heat flux. In this work, the effects of natural convection with and without the interaction of surface radiation in the system consisting of PV cells, optical funnels and a heatsink were numerically investigated with an experimentally validated model. The influence of inclination on the overall flow structure and heat transfer was examined. Under the effect of these funnels, the heat transfer was enhanced when the heat was transferred through PV cells to funnels. At the same time, the separation flow between the spaces of funnels would take the heat to the ambient. The minimum average temperature of surrogate PV cells occurred at the inclination angle of 60Ltd. When the inclination angle varied from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, the stagnation point moved from the downward surface of the heat sink towards the edge of heat sink. From 0 degrees to 60 degrees, the stagnation point was at the downward surface of heat sink and there was a dramatic decrease in the average temperature of the surrogate PV cells. When inclination angles were less than 60 degrees, except that there was a separation region above substrate, the side flow could flow in and out freely between adjacent funnels and then formed a pair of separation bubble, or spiral node, on top of the funnels. At these inclination angles, flow velocity was found to be the dominant factor influencing heat transfer because the flow pattern (separation bubble) was the same on top of the funnels. However, at inclination angles of 60 degrees to 90 degrees the stagnation point occurred at the edge of the heat sink, and the surrogate PV temperature increased. When the inclination angle reached 90, the flow was trapped and recirculated among funnels, and the vortical wake on top of the funnel disappeared. It can be concluded that from 60 degrees to 90 degrees, the dominant factor influencing heat transfer is funnel effect because the flow velocity stayed almost constant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to investigate the absorption properties of the TiO2/Fe2O3 structures. An increase in the absorbance of visible light in the range 380 nm to 600 nm has been observed when compared with pristine nanotubes. This is similar to the visible light absorbance enhancement observed in Ru-dye sensitized titania nanotubes.

This approach offers potential performance, cost and operational advantages compared to existing solar technologies, and to existing storage solutions for management of an electrical grid with a significant contribution of intermittent solar electricity generation. Here we analyze the theoretical conversion efficiency for new thermo-electro-chemical storage (TECS) plant schemes based on the electro-chemical systems of sodium-sulfur (Na-S) and zinc-air. The thermodynamic upper limit of solar to electricity conversion efficiency for an ideal TECS cycle is about 60% for Na-S at reactor temperature of 1550 K, and 65% for the zinc-air system at 1750 K, both under sunlight concentration of 3000. A hybrid process with carbothermic reduction in the zinc-air system reaches 60% theoretical efficiency at the more practical conditions of reaction temperature <1200 K and concentration <1000. Practical TECS plant efficiency, estimated from these upper limits, may then be much higher compared to existing solar electricity technologies. The technical and economical feasibility of the proposed cycle are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

It includes the user as part of the construction process responding to the customer's demands and wishes. To the present day, almost all proposals for Mass Customisation have been focused on the design phase and single family houses. The reality is that the processes carried out in the work execution are so inefficient that the costs of the Mass Customisation models are assumed by the customer and they do not offer solutions that support the change management. Furthermore, this inefficiency often makes Mass Customisation unfeasible in terms of deadlines and site management. Therefore, the present proposal focuses on achieving the paradigm of Mass Customisation in the traditional residential construction complementary to the existing proposals in the design phase. All this through the proposal of a framework for the integral management in the work execution, which will address change management introduced by the users offering an efficient and productive model that reduces costs in the process. This model will focus on the synergy between different strategies, techniques and technologies currently used in the construction management (such as Lean Construction or Six Sigma), together with, other strategies and technologies that have proven to be valid solutions in other fields (such as Business Process Management, Service Oriented Architecture, etc.)."

Lean construction emphasizes the concept of flow as a way to understand production in construction, yet there is still no accepted metric for measurement of flow quality. This has hampered research and practice. The proposed construction flow index (CFI) is a composite measure that reflects the quality of production flow in repetitive construction projects. It incorporates measures of work continuity for crews, processing continuity for locations, production rate variation, amounts of work in progress, interference and operation sequence logic. Expert knowledge was acquired to establish weights for the CFI parameters, and its use was tested in evaluating the planned and actual production flows for a number of projects. Project managers can use the CFI to evaluate the quality of their construction plans and to measure and communicate production flow quality status to trade crews, enabling management and improvement of production flow. The CFI is also a valuable tool for construction research. The CFI challenges traditional construction management by measuring flow, where standard practice only measures transformation (earned value). It challenges lean construction practice using the Last Planner System, suggesting that the percent plan complete measure of plan reliability is insufficient."

In this environment, identifying a company's competitive position enables a study of competitor strategies and the ability to select the most suitable path to profitability. This study suggests a methodology to analyze topological competiveness based on social relationships between firms modeled according to four subnetworks: Joint contract networks linked directly between firms, public and private networks linked indirectly by owners, and building and civil networks linked indirectly by work type. This study proposes an analytical framework measuring topological competiveness from four perspectives: The network topology among each subnetwork, centralities and structural positions among the firms, cohesive subgroups and strong relations in the subnetwork, and the structural equivalence among firms. Using 2,984 cases of Korean construction management projects from 1997 to 2013, an empirical analysis of topological competiveness validated the methodology to diagnose competitiveness and select the most suitable relationships with competitors to create company growth."

Thus, vibration suppression problem must be solved to guarantee the stability and control accuracy. A characteristic model based nonlinear golden section adaptive control (CMNGSAC) algorithm is implemented to suppress the vibration of a flexible Cartesian smart material manipulator driven by a ballscrew mechanism using an AC servomotor. The system modeling is derived to recognize the dynamical characteristics. The closed loop stability is analyzed based on the model. Also, an experimental setup is constructed to verify the adopted method. Experimental comparison studies are conducted for modal frequencies' identification and active vibration control of the flexible manipulator. The active vibration control experiments include set-point vibration control responses, vibration suppression under resonant excitation and simultaneous translating and vibration suppression using different control methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the controller can suppress both the larger and the lower amplitude vibration near the equilibrium point effectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A platform based on the Incompletely Restrained Positioning Mechanism (IRPM) is proposed, which uses the external force provided by a compliant flexible beam in each of the actuators. The compliant central column allows the configuration to achieve three degrees of freedom (3DOFs) with three tendons. The proposed flexible snake robot has been built using smart material, such as electroactive polymers (EAPs), which can be activated by applying power to it. Finally, the physical prototype of the snake robot has been built. An experiment has been performed in order to justify the proposed model."
442,Civil , Smart Material  , Large rotations; Smart structures; Geometrically nonlinear; Thin-walled structures        ,"A fully geometrically nonlinear finite element (FE) model is developed using large rotation shell theory for static analysis of composite and piezoelectric laminated thin-walled structures. The proposed large rotation theory is based on the first-order shear deformation (FOSD) hypothesis. It has six independent kinematic parameters which are expressed by five mechanical nodal degrees of freedom (DOFs). Linear electro-mechanically coupled constitutive equations with a constant electric field distribution through the thickness of each smart material layer are considered. Eight-node quadrilateral plate/shell elements with five mechanical DOFs per node and one electrical DOF per smart material layer are employed in the FE modeling. The present large rotation FE model is implemented into static analysis of both composite and piezoelectric laminated plates and shells. The equilibrium equation is solved by Newton-Raphson algorithm with system matrices updated in every iteration. The results are compared with those presented in the literature and others calculated by various simplified nonlinear shell theories. They indicate that large rotation theory has to be considered for the calculation of displacements and sensor output voltages of smart structures undergoing large deflections, since other simplified nonlinear theories fail to predict the static response precisely in many cases.

491,Civil , Smart Material  , Inverse model; Active composite plate; Iron-gallium alloy; Galfenol; Constitutive model; Magnetostriction        ,"A globally convergent and fully coupled 3D inverse model for smart materials is presented. In practice, stress and field (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are applied to smart materials whereas strain and flux density (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are measured. We refer to constitutive models that follow this scheme as direct models. In certain design and control situations, however, inverse models are necessary in which the field and stress are found from specified flux density and strain. This inversion typically involves an iterative procedure, which may be prone to convergence issues. An inverse model approach is proposed for arbitrary smart materials. The inversion requirement is a continuous and second order differentiable direct model for any chosen smart material. The approach is globally convergent, which makes it ideal for use in finite element frameworks. The premise of the proposed iterative system model is to constitute a recursive correction formula based on second order approximations of a novel scalar error function which offers a faster convergence rate. A continuation approach is then used to achieve global convergence for arbitrary input parameters. Magnetostrictive Galfenol is chosen to illustrate the effectiveness of the inverse model, and compact analytical derivations of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices are presented. The convergence rate of the proposed approach is superior to that of an existing inverse model. Finally, the inverse model's robustness is demonstrated through integration of the model into a finite-element framework to simulate a magnetostrictive composite plate actuator in full 3D.

The fluid-structure interaction between an individual valve and hydraulic fluid is modeled using the multiphysics software COMSOL; the results are validated with experimental testing on an array of miniature reeds. The performance of this array in a smart material actuator is compared with a larger, single-reed valve design.

1214,Medical , Addiction  , PTSD; Opioid addiction; Childhood maltreatment        ,"A range of risk factors lead to opioid use and substance-related problems (SRP) including childhood maltreatment, elevated impulsivity, and psychopathology. These constructs are highly interrelated such that childhood maltreatment is associated with elevated impulsivity and trauma-related psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and impulsivity particularly urgency and PTSD are related. Prior work has examined the association between these constructs and substance-related problems independently and it is unclear how these multi-faceted constructs (i.e., maltreatment types and positive and negative urgency) are associated with one another and SRP. The current study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relations among childhood maltreatment, trait urgency, PTSD symptoms, and SRP in a sample of individuals with a history of opioid use. An initial model that included paths from each type of childhood maltreatment, positive and negative urgency, PTSD and SRP did not fit the data well. A pruned model with excellent fit was identified that suggested emotional abuse, positive urgency, and negative urgency were directly related to PTSD symptoms and only PTSD symptoms were directly related to SRP. Furthermore, significant indirect effects suggested that emotional abuse and negative urgency were related to SRP via PTSD symptom severity. These results suggest that PTSD plays an important role in the severity of SRP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1612,Medical , Addiction  , Lung cancer; Small-molecule drug conjugate; Naltrexone        ,"A well-established approach to developing new imaging agents and treatments for cancer begins with the recognition of receptors that are overexpressed in cancer cells. Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (mu) and delta (delta) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or Tc-99m for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) or the delta-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEI( cells transfected with mu (HEK-mu) or delta (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity. These conjugates were abandoned from further development but information about their synthesis may be valuable to other laboratories working in this field. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

The current study aimed to examine the effects of huperzine A, a cholinesterase inhibitor, on behavioral sensitization induced by repeated morphine administration and relapse induced by contextual conditioning. The present study also assessed whether the state-dependency hypothesis may explain the results. Adult rats were divided into four groups (n=8) and intraperitoneally injected with 0.2, 0.3 or 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A or saline (1 ml/kg, control), for 5 days. The effect of repeated huperzine A administration alone on locomotor activity was assessed. For the experiments that analyzed the development of morphine-induced sensitization, 40 rats were divided into five groups (n=8): Saline+Saline, Saline+Morphine, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A+Morphine. Following a withdrawal period of 7 days, all animals were administered saline or morphine, as appropriate. To test the state-dependency hypothesis, the rats in the Saline+Morphine group were injected with saline and morphine, while the other three groups were administered different doses of huperzine A and morphine. To examine the effect of huperzine A on the expression of morphine-induced sensitization, the rats in huperzine A+Morphine groups were injected with appropriate concentrations of huperzine A, and morphine. The current results indicated that the administration of huperzine A alone did not affect locomotor activity, while higher doses of huperzine A inhibited the addictive behavior induced by morphine at the development phase. Additionally, huperzine A administration during the expression phase of morphine sensitization did not inhibit the relapse induced by administration of saline. Furthermore, 0.4 mg/kg huperzine A inhibited the expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. Therefore, the results of the current study do not support the state-dependency hypothesis."

Therefore, in seeking to overcome addiction, the rehabilitative journey must facilitate the fostering of autonomy. Here, in as much as autonomy is a socially embedded capacity, so must the therapeutic process-within this context, the client-counselor relationship-be grounded in an attentiveness to and facilitation of autonomy's dialogical antecedents. One such means of achieving this is through the counselor attending to and expressing their ""presence,"" in which they are engaged in a ""person-to-person"" therapeutic alliance underpinned by a collaborative dynamic. Here, the healthy interpersonal dyad between client and counselor can provide an environment through which the client may more fully recognize their autonomous resources and exercise such resources in a way that enables them to embark on the rehabilitative journey, and, attendant to this, autonomous living."

Prior studies have shown that compulsive-like' behaviors in rodents, for example, persistent responding for ethanol (EtOH) despite punishment, are increased after chronic exposure to EtOH. The main goal of the current study was to assess the effects of chronic intermittent EtOH (CIE) exposure on multiple, putative measures of compulsive-like EtOH seeking in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were exposed to two or four weekly cycles of CIE and then, post-withdrawal, tested for progressive ratio responding for EtOH, sustained responding during signaled EtOH unavailability and (footshock) punished suppression of responding for EtOH. Results showed that mice exposed to CIE exhibited attenuated suppression of EtOH seeking during punishment, as compared with air-exposed controls. By contrast, CIE exposure affected neither punished food reward-seeking behavior, nor other putative measures of compulsive-like EtOH seeking. Ex vivo reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of brain tissue found reduced sensitivity to punished EtOH seeking after CIE exposure was accompanied by a significant increase in gene expression of the GluN1 and GluN2A subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, specifically in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, slice electrophysiological analysis revealed increased N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated currents in the orbitofrontal cortex after CIE exposure in test-naive mice. Collectively, the current findings add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating that chronic exposure to EtOH fosters resistance to punished EtOH seeking in association with adaptations in cortical glutamatergic transmission."

However, the allergenic composition of AAP is still unknown and has yet to be characterized. The present study aimed to identify AAP allergens using a proteomics-based approach. For this purpose, optimized AAP protein extracts were analyzed using 1D- and 2D- gel electrophoresis and confronted to twenty sera from individuals with respiratory allergy during the AAP season. Candidate allergens were detected using the serum from an allergic patient with clinical history of AAP pollinosis. IgE-binding spots were identified using MALDI-TOF/OF mass spectrometry and database searching. According to our results, AAP extracts were rich in proteins (up to 16.25 mg/ml) with a molecular-weight distribution ranging from 10 to 175 kDa. Two-D electrophoresis of AAP extracts revealed 125 protein spots from which 13 were IgE reactive. These IgE-binding proteins were identified as enolase, calreticulin, probable pectate lyase 6, conserved hypothetical protein and ras-related protein RHN1-like. By our knowledge, this study is the first report identifying AAP allergens. These findings will open up further avenues for the diagnosis and immunotherapy of the AAP allergy as well as for the cloning and molecular characterization of relevant allergens. Biological significance: Ailanthus altissima colonizes new areas every year in Iran and is spreading aggressively worldwide. According to USDA, the tree of heaven is now present as an invasive plant in 30 states in US (www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/plants/treeheaven.shtml) and come to dominate large areas in many regions. Up to now, several cases of allergy to A. altissima pollen have been reported in United States, Italy and Iran [14]. However, there is still no information on the sensitizing allergens and the molecular origin of these clinical symptoms, which constitutes a serious threat to patients suffering from respiratory allergies in these regions. To our knowledge, the current study describes, therefore, the first panel of proteins responsible for IgE-mediated A. altissima pollinosis by using a gel-based proteomic approach. This work represents the pioneer proteomic investigation on Simaroubaceae spp. and provides useful insights for further studies on the allergens of this widely distributed plant family.

METHODS Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic asthma and beta-lactoglobulin-induced food allergy mouse models were used in this study. Following oral administration of B. infantis CGMCC313-2 during or after allergen sensitization, histopathologic changes in the lung and intestine were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. In the allergic asthma mouse model, we evaluated the proportion of lung-infiltrating inflammatory cells. OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 levels in serum and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were also assessed. In the food allergy mouse model, the levels of total IgE and cytokines in serum were measured. RESULTS Oral administration of B. infantis CGMCC313-2 during or after allergen sensitization suppressed allergic inflammation in lung and intestinal tissues, while the proportion of infiltrating inflammatory cells was significantly decreased in the BALF of allergic asthma mice. Moreover, B. infantis CGMCC313-2 decreased the serum levels of total IgE in food allergy mice, and reductions in IgE and IgG1 were also observed in OVA-induced allergic asthma mice. The expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 in both serum and BALF was suppressed following the administration of B. infantis CGMCC313-2, while an effect on serum IL-10 levels was not observed. CONCLUSION B. infantis CGMCC313-2 inhibits the secretion of allergen-induced IgE, IL-4 and IL-13, and attenuates allergic inflammation."

While 85% of children outgrow allergies including cow's milk and eggs by five years of age, allergies to peanuts and seafood continue into adulthood. The school setting poses a high-risk environment for allergen exposure. The aim of the present study was to examine the availability, drivers and communication of school food allergy awareness and management policies/guidelines in one Australian education jurisdiction. Methods: A cross-sectional study comprising an online survey of principals on school allergy awareness (n = 100) was conducted in public, catholic and independent primary and high schools in an Australian education jurisdiction between August 2011 and November 2012. Results: Sixty-three per cent (17/27) of schools responding to the survey reported using food allergy management guidelines. An average of 13 students per school were reported to have a food allergy with 93% of schools reported having students with at least one food allergy. Parents, not government policy, were identified as primary drivers of food allergy guideline implementation and a third of schools provided anaphylaxis training annually. Communication of food allergy management was limited with only 42 school websites either providing access to policies/guidelines or providing a food allergy statement. Conclusions: Detailed awareness and management guidelines are integral for schools to adequately manage food-induced allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in the school environment. To enable this, national government support through legislation and policy is needed to ensure a consistent, up-to-date and policed approach to food allergy management in the Australian education sector."

Methods: We performed an epigenome-wide association study to investigate the association between DNA methylation and IgE level, allergen-specific IgE and self-reported immune diseases and allergies in 728 individuals. Results: We identified and replicated 15 CpG sites associated with IgE, mapping to biologically relevant genes, including ACOT7, ILR5A, KCNH2, PRG2 and EPX. A total of 331 loci were associated with allergen-specific IgE, but none of these CpG sites were associated with self-reported allergies and immune diseases. Conclusion: This study shows that IgE levels are associated with DNA methylation levels at numerous CpG sites, which might provide new leads for investigating the links between IgE and allergic inflammation."

This study compared health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children allergic to wheat or grass. Methods: We surveyed 63 children with wheat allergies (median age of five) and 72 with grass allergies (median age 12), with their parents. The Child Health Questionnaires for parents (CHQ-PF28) and children (CHQ-CF87) were applied. Results: The parents of children in the wheat group recorded significantly lower CHQ-PF28 scores for the impact of their child's allergy on general behaviour, general health perceptions, parental impact of emotions and time and family activities, than the parents of children with grass allergies (p values <= 0.001). However, parents in the grass group recorded lower scores for the change in health item than the parents of children with wheat allergies (p = 0.020). In the grass group, children and parents reported similar scores for the different questions, but there was poorer correlation between parents and children in the wheat allergy group. Conclusion: HRQoL was lower in children with wheat than grass allergies according to parental reports, with more consistent perceptions of HRQoL among parents and children in the grass allergy than wheat allergy group."

In this study, we first assessed the patterns of brain tau tangle accumulation (measured with the positron emission tomography tracer F-18-AV-1451) associated with well-established Alzheimer's disease factors in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. We then explored highly associated patterns of greater F-18-AV-1451 binding and increased annualized change in cortical amyloid-beta plaques measured as florbetapir positron emission tomography binding antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, and to what extent these multimodal pattern associations explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independently and jointly. We found that: (i) F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention was differentially associated with age, and cross-sectional florbetapir positron emission tomography retention, but not with years of education, gender, or APOE genotype; (ii) increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, in the parieto-temporal and precuneus brain regions was associated with greater F-18-AV-1451 PET retention most prominently in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the full cohort, with florbetapir positive/negative-associated variability; and (iii) this F-18-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention pattern significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independent of the associated antecedent increased annualized change in florbetapir positron emission tomography retention. These findings are in agreement with the pathology literature, which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloid-beta plaques correlate with cognition and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, non-local associations linking increased amyloid-beta accumulation rates with increased tau deposition are of great interest and support the idea that the amyloid-beta pathology might have remote effects in disease pathology spread potentially via the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks."

In vitro results revealed potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity for some of these compounds and all of them showed moderate antioxidant properties. Compounds 12a, 12b and 12c were the most potent AChE inhibitors, highlighting 12a with IC50 = 0.46 mu M. In addition, these three most promising compounds exhibited significant in vivo anti-inflammatory activity in the mice paw edema, pleurisy and formalin-induced hyperalgesy models, in vitro metal chelator activity for Cu2+ and Fe2+, and neuroprotection of human neuronal cells against oxidative damage. Molecular docking studies corroborated the in vitro inhibitory mode of interaction of these active compounds on AChE. Based on these data, compound 12a was identified as a novel promising drug prototype candidate for the treatment of AD with innovative structural feature and multitarget effects.

So, nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) plays an important role in the treatment of AD. However, current PPAR gamma-targeting drugs such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are associated with undesirable side effects. We identified herbal extract with a small molecular, astragaloside IV (AS-IV), as a selective PPAR gamma natural agonist in nervous cells by developing a PPAR-PPRE pathway regulatory system. Cultured SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-BACE1 were treated with AS-IV for 24 h or AS-IV plus the PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662 in vitro. APP/PS1 mice were intragastrically treated with AS-IV or AS-IV plus the GW9662 every 48 h for 3 months. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and real-time PCR were used to examine the expression of PPAR gamma and BACE1. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to analyze the distribution of A beta plaques in the APP/PS1 mouse brain. The levels of A beta were determined using ELISA kits. AS-IV was shown to be a PPAR gamma agonist by establishing a high-throughput screening model for PPAR gamma agonists. The results showed that AS-IV treatment increased activity of PPAR gamma and inhibited BACE1 in vitro. As a result, A beta levels decreased significantly. GW9662, which is a PPAR gamma antagonist, significantly blocked the beneficial role of AS-IV. In vivo, AS-IV treatment increased PPAR gamma and BACE1 expression and reduced neuritic plaque formation and A beta levels in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. These effects of AS-IV could be effectively inhibited by GW9662. These results indicate that AS-IV may be a natural PPAR gamma agonist that suppressed activity of BACE1 and ultimately attenuates generation of A beta. Therefore, AS-IV may be a promising agent for modulating A beta-related pathology in AD."

The chemical structures of these heterocycles consist of a central pyrimidine ring having a phenyl group and pyrimidine groups with sulfonamide motifs. The enzyme inhibitory potential of these compounds was investigated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) because these enzymes play a crucial role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. As compared to the reference compound eserine (IC50=0.04 +/- 0.0001 mu M for AChE and IC50=0.85 +/- 0.0001 mu M for BChE), the IC50 values of the synthesized compounds ranged from 3.73 +/- 0.61 mu M to 57.36 +/- 0.22 mu M for AChE and 4.81 +/- 0.16 mu M to 111.61 +/- 0.53 mu M for BChE. Among these tested compounds, 6j having a -CH3 group was found to be the most potent one against both enzymes (AChE, IC50=3.73 +/- 0.61 mu M; BChE, IC50=4.81 +/- 0.16 mu M). Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and molecular docking studies of the synthesized compounds were also performed."

J. Med. Chem. 2015, 89, 349e361). The results of in vitro biological activity evaluation, including beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregation inhibition, cholinesterase inhibition, and antioxidant activity, showed that introduction of N-methyl in quinoline ring significantly improved the anti-AD potential of compounds. The optimal compound, compound a12, dramatically attenuated the cell death of glutamate-induced HT22 cells by preventing the generation of ROS and increasing the level of GSH. Most importantly, intragastric administration of a12 circle HAc was well tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg and could traverse blood-brain barrier. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

METHODS We included 117 consecutive patients with AP as the AP group and 34 consecutive patients with colorectal polyps (before endoscopic treatment) as the control group. Complete blood counts, liver function, platelet indices (MPV), coagulation parameters, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after admission. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of MPV, white blood cell (WBC), LDH and CRP in predicting AP severity. The Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and the 2012 revised Atlanta criteria were used to evaluate disease severity in AP. RESULTS MPV levels were significantly lower in the AP group than in the control group on day 1 (P = 0.000), day 2 (P = 0.029) and day 3 (P = 0.001) after admission. In addition, MPV values were lower on day 1 after admission than on day 2 (P = 0.012), day 3 (P = 0.000) and day 7 (P = 0.002) in all AP patients. Based on the mGPS, 78 patients (66.7%) were diagnosed with mild and 39 patients (33.3%) with severe AP. There was no significant difference in mean MPV levels between patients diagnosed with mild and severe AP based on the mGPS (P = 0.424). According to the 2012 revised Atlanta criteria, there were 98 patients (83.8%) without persistent organ failure (OF) [ non-severe acute pancreatitis (non-SAP) group] and 19 patients (16.2%) with persistent OF (SAP group). MPV levels were significantly lower in the SAP group than in the non-SAP group on day 1 after admission (P = 0.002). On day 1 after admission using a cut-off value of 6.65 fL, the overall accuracy of MPV for predicting SAP according to the 2012 revised Atlanta criteria (AUC = 0.716) had a sensitivity of 91.8% and a specificity of 47.4% and was superior to the accuracy of the traditional markers WBC (AUC = 0.700) and LDH (AUC = 0.697). CONCLUSION MPV can be used at no additional cost as a useful, noninvasive biomarker that distinguishes AP with persistent OF from AP without persistent OF on day 1 of hospital admission."

Methods: A systematic search was conducted from the PubMed, ENBASE, and Springer link database up to April 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to assess the strength of association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) and AS risk. A subgroup analysis based on geographic region and a sensitivity analysis were also conducted. Results: Five studies were eligible for meta-analysis, including 918 cases and 845 controls. The results showed that no significant association was found between AS and CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) for the additive model (G vs. A), dominant model (GG+AG vs. AA), co-dominant model (GG vs. AA, AG vs. AA) and recessive model (GG vs. AG+AA). The OR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.38), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.89-1.51), 1.05 (95% CI, 0.75-1.46), 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.52) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.79-1.23), respectively. Although subgroup analysis demonstrated no association between CTLA-4 (+49 A/G) polymorphisms and susceptibility to AS in Europe and Taiwan, an association was found in Iran through both the co-dominant and dominant models. Exclusion of any individual study did not alter the significance of the final outcome, excepting the result by omitting the study by Huang etal. Conclusions: The present results suggest that the CTLA-4 may not be a major susceptibility locus in humans with AS. The relationship between them may be affected by different geographic populations."

Methods: The 2013 China Health Insurance Research Association (CHIRA) urban insurance claims database was used to identify patients with AS. The identified patients were stratified by AS treatments for the comparisons of well established AS-related complications and direct medical costs. Conventional regression analyses adjusted the collected patient baseline characteristics to confirm the impact of treatments on complications and direct medical costs. Results: Of the identified 1299 patients with AS, 18.0% received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), 11.2% received immunosuppressant, 48.2% received NSAID plus immunosuppressant, 4.6% received biologic agents, and 17.9% received medications without indication for AS. Biologic group was associated with the lowest proportion of AS-related complications (8.3%) that was confirmed by multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio = 0.200, p=.017). The biologic group was also associated with highest direct medical costs (median: RMB=14,539) that were confirmed by the multiple generalized linear model (coefficient = 1.644, p<.001). Conclusions: Biologics were not commonly used for AS in Chinese patients likely due to their high cost. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential long-term clinical benefits associated biologic treatment for AS."

Material and Methods: Periodontal, inflammatory and platelet indices were compared between 59 GAgP patients and 59 healthy subjects. Gingival biopsies from five patients and five healthy subjects were examined by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Changes in patient periodontal and platelet indices were re-evaluated at 3 months after periodontal therapy. Results: Platelet size was decreased significantly in GAgP patients compared to healthy subjects (p <= 0.003). Weak negative correlations between platelet size and periodontal parameters were found in GAgP patients (p <= 0.025). Platelet aggregates and adhesion to the endothelium or leucocytes were found in venules and connective tissues of gingival biopsies from GAgP patients. Mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet large cell ratio increased after periodontal therapy in GAgP patients (p <= 0.038). The increase in MPV was related to the decrease in bleeding index in GAgP patients after periodontal therapy (p < 0.001; r = 0.357). Conclusion: Platelet size was reduced in GAgP patients compared to healthy controls, possibly due to the consumption of large platelets at sites of periodontal inflammation. Platelets may be involved in host responses to periodontal infection in GAgP."

We employed simple linear regression analysis of a cross-sectional dataset, and fixed effect, random effect and pooled linear regression of a longitudinal dataset.Results: We showed that BASFI and ASDAS-CRP are very strong, robust predictors of EQ-5D utilities in all regression specifications together with sex (female), invalidity, and activity impairment. Additionally, the longitudinal regression analysis showed that a fixed effect model may be a viable alternative to the most commonly used random effect model or pooled linear regression due to the nature of our dataset.Conclusion: This is one of the first studies using a fixed effect model in longitudinal patient-level data, although, this method has been widely used in economics."
1520,Medical , Anxiety  , Threat detection; Emotion perception; Backward-masking; Face perception; Amygdala; Anxiety        ,"A theoretical concern in addressing the unconscious perception of emotion is the extent to which participants can access experiential properties of masked facial stimuli. Performance on a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) task as a measure of objective awareness was compared with a new measure developed to access experiential phenomena of the target-mask transition, the perceptual contrast-change sensitivity (PCCS) measure in a backward-masking paradigm with angry, happy and neutral facial expressions. Whilst 2AFC performance indicated that the targets were successfully masked, PCCS values were significantly higher in the happy-neutral face condition than in the angry-neutral face and the neutral neutral face conditions (Experiment 1). Furthermore, objective measures of awareness were more readily displayed by individuals with high trait anxiety, whereas individuals with low trait anxiety showed greater access to the experiential quality of happy faces (Experiment 2). These findings provide important insights into the methodological considerations involved in the study of non-conscious processing of emotions, both with respect to individual differences in anxiety and the extent to which certain expressions can be successfully masked relative to others. Furthermore, our results may be informative to work investigating the neural correlates of conscious versus unconscious perception of emotion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Early-life adversity increases the risk of developing a number of disorders, such as chronic pain, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Although much of the research has examined the impact of physical maltreatment, an increasing number of studies have been published over the past few years examining the effect of childhood psychological stress and trauma on the development of various types of chronic pain conditions. We review the clinical and preclinical data examining the link among early-life psychological stress, altered nociceptive behavior, and chronic pain in later life. Evidence supporting a role for certain key neurobiological substrates, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; monoaminergic, opioidergic, endocannabinoid and immune systems; and epigenetic mechanisms in the association between early-life psychological stress and chronic pain, is provided. Greater understanding of the impact of early-life stress may inform the development of personalized treatments for chronic pain in later life and strategies to prevent its onset in susceptible individuals.

Although there is a considerable amount of studies investigating mobile learning acceptance, little research exists that investigates the driving factors that influence students' intention to use mobile technologies for assessment purposes. The aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the acceptance of Mobile-Based Assessment (MBA), the assessment delivered through mobile devices and technologies. The proposed model, Mobile-Based Assessment Acceptance Model (MBAAM) is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). MBAAM extends TAM in the context of MBA by adding to the Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness, the constructs of Facilitating Conditions, Social Influence, Mobile Device Anxiety, Personal Innovativeness, Mobile-Self-Efficacy, Perceived Trust, Content, Cognitive Feedback, User Interface and Perceived Ubiquity Value and investigates their impact on the Behavioral Intention to Use MBA. 145 students from a European senior-level secondary school experienced a series of mobile-based assessments for a three-week period. Structured equation modeling was used to analyze quantitative survey data. According to the results, MBAAM explains and predicts approximately 47% of the variance of Behavioral Intention to Use Mobile-Based Assessment. The study provides a better understanding towards developing mobile-based assessments that support learners, enhance learning experience and promote learning, taking advantage of the distinguished features that mobile devices may offer. Implications are discussed within the wider context of mobile learning acceptance research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Prenatally stressed offspring rats were used to investigate the potential antidepressive-like effects of imperatorin (IMP) extracted from the root of radix angelica. After 4 weeks of treatment of IMP, behavioral tests (sucrose-preference test, forced-swimming test, and open-field test) were measured. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serotonin transporters (5-HTT) and 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) mRNA expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were also determined by real-time PCR. Administration with IMP (15 and 30 mg/kg/day, intragastrically) for 28 days markedly increased the percentage of sucrose (anhedonia), decreased the immobility time, and increased the number of total crossings, center crossings, rearing, and grooming in the male prenatally stressed offspring. Meanwhile, we found that 5-HT concentration in the hippocampus and frontal cortex was significantly increased in the IMP-treated group. Subsequently, we found significantly decreased 5-HTT and increased 5-HT1AR mRNA expressions in the hippocampus and frontal cortex after IMP treatment in the prenatally stressed male offspring. IMP showed antidepressive-like effects and increased 5-HT concentration in male prenatally stressed offspring, suggesting that IMP could be of therapeutic use in preventing depressive-like behavior in adolescence.

1332,Medical , Asthma  , asthma; education; prevention; shared decision making; adherence        ,"A shared approach to decision-making framework has been suggested for chronic disease management especially where multiple treatment options exist. Shared decision-making (SDM) requires that both physician and patients are actively engaged in the decision-making process, including information exchange; expressing treatment preferences; as well as agreement over the final treatment decision. Although SDM appears well supported by patients, practitioners and policymakers alike, the current challenge is to determine how best to make SDM a reality in everyday clinical practice. Within the context of asthma, adherence rates are poor and are linked to outcomes such as reduced asthma control, increased symptoms, healthcare expenditures, and lower patient quality of life. It has been suggested that SDM can improve treatment adherence and that ignoring patients' personal goals and preferences may result in reduced rates of adherence. Furthermore, understanding predictors of poor treatment adherence is a necessary step toward developing effective strategies to improve the patient-reported and clinically important outcomes. Here, we describe why a shared approach to treatment decision-making for asthma has the potential to be an effective tool for improving adherence, with associated clinical and patient-related outcomes. In addition, we explore insights into the reasons why SDM has not been implemented into routine clinical practice."

Isoprostanes are stable products of arachidonic acid peroxidation and are regarded as the most reliable markers of oxidative stress in vivo. Validation of method was performed by evaluation of the key analytical parameters such as: matrix effect, analytical curve, trueness, precision, limits of detection and limits of quantification. As a homoscedasticity was not met for analytical data, weighted linear regression was applied in order to improve the accuracy at the lower end points of calibration curve. The detection limits (LODs) ranged from 1.0 to 2.1 pg/mL. For plasma samples spiked with the isoprostanes at the level of 50 pg/mL, intra-and interday repeatability ranged from 2.1 to 3.5% and 0.1 to 5.1%, respectively. The applicability of the proposed approach has been verified by monitoring of isoprostane isomers level in plasma samples collected from young patients (n = 8) subjected to hyperbaric hyperoxia (100% oxygen at 280 kPa(a) for 30 min) in a multiplace hyperbaric chamber.

AMCase is most active at pH 2.0, and its activity gradually decreases to up to pH 8. Here we analyzed chitin degradation by AMCase in weak acidic to neutral conditions by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis established originally for oligosaccharides analysis. We found that specific fragments with slower-than-expected mobility as defined by chitin oligosaccharide markers were generated at pH 5.0 similar to 8.0 as by-products of the reaction. We established an improved method for chitin oligosaccharides suppressing this side reaction by pre-acidification of the fluorophore-labeling reaction mixture. Our improved method specifically detects chitin oligosaccharides and warrants quantification of up to 50 nmol of the material. Using this strategy, we found that AMCase produced dimer of N-acetyl-n-glucosamine (G1cNAc) at strong acidic to neutral condition. Moreover, we found that AMCase generates (GIcNAc)(2) as well as (GIcNAc)(3) under physiological conditions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Omalizumab (Xolair(TM)) is a recombinant DNA-derived, humanized antibody. OMZ-SPT is a polypeptide on the heavy chain of omalizumab monoclonal antibody. Here, we found that intramuscular administration of OMZ-SPT significantly improved survival and attenuated lung inflammation in female C57BL/6 mice suffering from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. We also demonstrated that OMZ-SPT can inhibit expression of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 by ELISA in mice suffering from LPS-induced ALI and a mouse macrophage line (RAW264.7 cells). In addition, we showed that OMZ-SPT inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling and total expression of NF-kappa B by western blotting. These data suggest that OMZ-SPT could be a novel therapeutic choice for ALI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Long-standing asthma induces airway remodeling, leading to intractable asthma. The number of patients with asthma has increased; however, the number of patients who die of asthma has decreased (1.2 per 100,000 patients in 2015). The goal of asthma treatment is to enable patients with asthma to attain normal pulmonary function and lead a normal life, without any symptoms. A good relationship between physicians and patients is indispensable for appropriate treatment. Long-term management by therapeutic agents and elimination of the causes and risk factors of asthma are fundamental to its treatment. Four steps in pharmacotherapy differentiate between mild and intensive treatments; each step includes an appropriate daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, varying from low to high levels. Long-acting beta(2)-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, sustained-release theophylline, and long-acting muscarinic antagonist are recommended as add-on drugs, while anti-immunoglobulin E antibody and oral steroids are considered for the most severe and persistent asthma related to allergic reactions. Bronchial thermoplasty has recently been developed for severe, persistent asthma, but its long-term efficacy is not known. Inhaled beta(2)-agonists, aminophylline, corticosteroids, adrenaline, oxygen therapy, and other approaches are used as needed during acute exacerbations, by choosing treatment steps for asthma in accordance with the severity of exacerbations. Allergic rhinitis, eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic otitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aspirin-induced asthma, and pregnancy are also important issues that need to be considered in asthma therapy.

We have performed an open-label, multicenter, phase III study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of bilastine, a novel non-sedating H-1-antihistamine for patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) or pruritus associated with skin diseases (trial registration no. JapicCTI-142528). Patients aged 18-74 years were treated with bilastine 20 mg once daily for up to 52 weeks. Safety and tolerability were assessed on the basis of adverse events (AE), bilastine-related AE, laboratory tests and vital signs. Efficacy was assessed based on rash score, itch score, overall improvement and quality of life. One hundred and ninety-eight patients enrolled, 122 of whom (61.6%) completed the 52-week treatment period. AE were reported in 64.5% and bilastine-related AE in 2.5% of patients throughout the 52-week treatment period. All AE were mild to moderate in severity. AE associated with the nervous system occurred in 10 patients (5.1%) including seven patients (3.6%) with headache. Somnolence reported in two of these patients (1.0%) was related to bilastine. All efficacy variables improved during treatment with bilastine. In conclusion, long-term treatment with bilastine 20 mg once daily for 52 weeks is safe and well tolerated in Japanese patients with CSU or pruritus associated with skin diseases. Bilastine improved disease symptoms of both conditions early in treatment, and the efficacy was maintained throughout the treatment."
1691,Medical , Atopic Dermatitis  , gene therapy; plasmid DNA; nonviral gene delivery; protein binding; targeted drug delivery        ,"Accelerated formation of fibrin clots in a tumor microenvironment can be used for targeted delivery of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) to tumor cells. Here, we selected cysteine-arginine-glutamic acid-lysine-alanine (CREKA) as the fibrin clot-binding peptide and designed 2 types of fusion proteins for tumor targeting. The CREKA peptide was fused to IFN gamma's C-terminus, with or without a matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2)-cleavable linker (IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA or IFN gamma-CREKA, respectively). The former was designed to release IFN gamma from IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA bound to fibrin clots, to ensure IFN gamma's function in the tumor milieu. IFN gamma-activated sequence-dependent reporter gene expression in B16-BL6 cells revealed that the biological activities of IFNg-CREKA and IFN gamma were comparable, whereas that of IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA was approximately 60% that of IFNg. Plasma concentrations of IFN gamma-CREKA and IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA remained at effective levels for at least 4 weeks after gene transfer into mice. After gene transfer to tumor-bearing mice, intratumoral concentration of IFN gamma in pCpG-IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA group was tended to be higher than those of the other groups. Inhibition of colon-26 tumor growth was significantly more with gene transfer of IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA than with IFNg or IFN gamma-CREKA. These results indicate that targeted delivery of IFN gamma to fibrin clots through IFN gamma-mmp-CREKA fusion can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of IFN gamma in cancer gene therapy.

This study examined whether atopic dermatitis increased the likelihood of polysensitisation, namely sensitisation to five or more allergens. Methods: We examined the electronic hospital charts of 1743 children aged 0-17 years who had visited primary or secondary care physicians with allergic symptoms, whose blood was examined for the presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the 10 most common inhaled and food allergens and whose files contained documentation of the presence of atopic dermatitis and other skin disorders. Sensitisation was defined as a specific IgE level of >= 0.35 kU/L. Results: Polysensitisation was more common in children with atopic dermatitis (268/1197, 22.4%) than those without (30/546, 5.5%, p < 0.001). This remained significant after adjustment for gender and age in a multiple logistic regression model (odds ratio: 5.63, 95% confidence interval 3.77-8.40). Other skin disorders did not show an increased risk of polysensitisation (5/97, 5.2%). Conclusion: Polysensitisation was considerably more common in children with atopic dermatitis than those without. This supports the hypothesis that sensitisation occurs through a defective skin barrier and appears to be specific for atopic dermatitis."

In all patients serum IL-10 levels were detected. Results: Significant Score Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index point differences between breastfed and not breastfed children (p <0.001) have been detected. The serum IL-10 levels were lower in children with CMPA-related AEDS as compared to the healthy control group (p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between serum IL-10 levels and SCORAD in both enrolled groups has been also noted. In particular, IL-10 levels, in both groups, were significantly lower in children with severe symptoms. Conversely, serum IL-10 levels were significantly increased in children with mild-severe symptoms in both groups. Furthermore, breastfed children, with lower severe symptoms, had higher serum IL-10 levels. Finally, serum total IgE levels were negatively correlated with serum IL-10 levels in both breastfed and non-breastfed children with CMPA-related AEDS (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We reported that exclusive breast-feeding induces hyposensitization in children with CMPA-related AEDS and it is associated with minor disease severity and higher serum IL-10 levels, resulting as useful disease-monitor marker.

2745,Medical , Atopic Dermatitis  , antimicrobials; biofilms; probiotics; quorum sensing; Staphylococci        ,"AimsWhen skin dysbiosis occurs as a result of skin disorders, probiotics can act as modulators, restoring microbial balance. Several properties of selected probiotics were evaluated so that their topical application could be considered. Methods and ResultsAdhesion, antimicrobial, quorum sensing and antibiofilm assays were carried out with several probiotic strains and tested against selected skin pathogens. All tested strains displayed significant adhesion to keratin. All lactobacilli with the exception of Lactobacillus delbrueckii, showed antimicrobial activity against skin pathogens, mainly due to organic acid production. Most of them also prevented biofilm formation, but only Propioniferax innocua was able to break down mature biofilms. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that although all tested probiotics adhered to human keratin, they showed limited ability to prevent adhesion of some potential skin pathogens. Most of the tested probiotics successfully prevented biofilm formation, suggesting that they may be successfully used in the future as a complement to conventional therapies in the treatment of a range of skin disorders. Significance and Impact of studyThe topically used probiotics may be a natural, targeted treatment approach to several skin disorders and a complement to conventional therapies which present many undesirable side effects."

In this study, we evaluated the ability of the PARTNERS HF criteria to detect initial decompensation in a population of moderate heart failure patients under remote monitoring. Methods: We retrospectively applied the PARTNERS HF criteria to 1860 transmissions from 104 patients (median follow up 21 months; range 1-67 months), who were enrolled in our programme of telemedicine after cardiac resynchronisation therapy. We tested the ability of a score based on these criteria to predict any acute clinical decompensation occurring in the 15 days following a transmission. Results: In 441 cases, acute heart failure was diagnosed after the index transmission. The area under the curve (AUC) of the score for the diagnosis of acute decompensation was 0.752 (confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.728-0.777). The best score cut-off was consistent with the results of PARTNERS HF: with a score >= 2, sensitivity was 75% and specificity 68%. The odds ratio for events was 6.24 (CI 95% 4.90-7.95; p<0.001). Conclusions: When retrospectively applied to remote monitoring transmissions and arranged in a score, PARTNERS HF criteria could identify HF patients who subsequently developed acute decompensation. These results warrant prospective studies applying PARTNERS HF criteria to remote monitoring."
2441,Medical , Atrial Fibrillation  , suPAR; ischemic stroke; inflammation; mortality; cardioembolic        ,"Aim: We evaluated soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels in different stroke subtypes and assessed their prognostic value regarding 5-year outcomes. Materials and Methods: The study included 117 stroke patients (81 males; mean=age 61 +/- 11 years) with suspected cardioembolic stroke whose plasma suPAR concentration was assessed. Altogether, 20 (17.1%) patients suffered from stroke as a result of cardioembolism, 12 (10.3%) from large-artery atherosclerosis, 9 (7.7%) from small-vessel disease, 11 (9.4%) from both large-artery and cardioembolic etiology, and 65 (55.6%) had cryptogenic stroke. The mean followup period was 5 years. Results: suPAR concentration was higher in patients who suffered from stroke/transient ischemic attack due to large-artery atherosclerosis (3.2 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) compared to small-vessel disease (2.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml, p<0.001). An elevated plasma suPAR concentration was associated with all-cause mortality during the followup period (p=0.003). Conclusion: Elevated plasma suPAR concentrations predicted all-cause mortality during the 5-year follow-up after ischemic stroke. suPAR was not able to differentiate patients with cardioembolic stroke from those with other stroke types."

The aim of the study was to evaluate Ca2+ handling, left ventricular (LV) contractile response during Ca2+ administration compared to exercise, as well as oxygen consumption and mechanical efficiency after 48h of RP. MethodsFifty-three mongrel dogs were instrumented to measure LV pressure, LV fractional shortening, regional wall thickening and coronary blood flow. Contractile reserve was measured with isoproterenol and intravenous (IV) Ca2+ administration. To assess the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), post-extrasystolic potentiation (PESP) and SR Ca2+ uptake were measured. A graded treadmill test was performed in baseline and after RP (n=14). In a separate group of animals (n=5), myocardial performance and oxygen consumption were measured using a wide range of loading conditions. ResultsLeft ventricular contractility was significantly decreased upon cessation of pacing. The contractile response to isoproterenol was blunted compared to a preserved response to IV Ca2+. Post-extrasystolic potentiation was slightly increased after RP. Maximal velocity (V-max) of SR Ca2+ uptake was unchanged. Contractile response during exercise is attenuated after RP. External work is reduced, whereas oxygen consumption is preserved, provoking a reduced mechanical efficiency. ConclusionForty-eight-hours RP provokes a reversible LV dysfunction, while the SR function and response to exogenous Ca2+ are preserved. This is compatible with an intracellular functional remodelling to counteract Ca2+ overload provoked by RP. Left ventricular dysfunction is accompanied by a reduced contractile reserve, but an unchanged oxygen consumption, illustrating an alteration in oxygen utilization."
2534,Medical , Atrial Fibrillation  , Heart failure; Albumin; Hospital mortality; Outcome        ,"Aims Hypoalbuminemia is common in heart failure (HF), especially in elderly patients. It is associated with an increased risk of death. The present study sought to examine the prognostic significance of serum albumin level in the prediction of hospital mortality in patients admitted for acute non-ischemic HF. Methods and results We examined the association between albumin and hospital mortality in a cohort of 546 patients admitted for acute non-ischemic HF. None of the patients had infectious disease, severe arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation), required invasive ventilation, or presented with acute coronary syndrome or primary valvular disease. Thirty-six patients (7%) died during the hospital stay. These patients were significantly older (78 +/- 9 vs. 72 +/- 12years; P = 0.006), had higher heart rate (P < 0.0001), increased creatinine level (P = 0.01), lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P < 0.05), elevated leucocyte count (P = 0.001), and lower albumin levels (31.3 +/- 5.6 g/L vs. 36.9 +/- 4.1g/L; P < 0.001). With multivariable analysis, age (P = 0.01), heart rate (P < 0.0003), diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01), leukocyte count (P = 0.009), and serum albumin level (P < 0.0001) emerged as independent predictors of hospital mortality. Hypoalbuminemia (<34g/L) yielded the best sensitivity (78.8%) and specificity (75%) for predicting hospital death. Conclusions Serum albumin level measured at admission can serve as a simple prognostic factor in acute non-ischemic HF. Hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased risk of hospital mortality, especially in elderly patients."

Methods A 10-min tilting test and a transthoracic echocardiogram focused on ventricular septal systolic )S wave) and diastolic function )isovolumic relaxation time) were performed. Low frequency on high frequency ratio )LF/HF) and RR variation )variation of beat to beat intervals) in response to passive orthostatism were used as measures of sympathetic reflex activation [delta LF/HF )D-LF/HF) and delta RR )DRR), respectively]. Brain natriuretic peptide was measured. Results A total of 50 HCM patients were categorized in two groups: D-LF/HF more than 0 )group 1, sympathetic response) and D-LF/HF 0 or less )group 2, parasympathetic response). Patients in group 2 had higher New York Heart Association class, a more frequent history of atrial fibrillation )38 versus 9% P=0.04) or syncope )46 versus 12% P=0.01) and an increased septal isovolumic relaxation time )122 versus 82ms P=0.02). The same categorization was made according to lowest quartile DRR )DRR at least 23 ms, group 1: sympathetic response; DRR less than 23 ms, group 2: parasympathetic response). In group 2, patients were older, with advanced New York Heart Association class and higher history of atrial fibrillation. Conclusions Autonomic response to passive orthostatism in HCM appears correlated with specific functional features of the hypertrophic heart. Altered neural afferent traffic from the localized area of segmental hypertrophy resulted in autonomic changes with a blunted sympathetic response, and an inappropriate vagal activation, especially in patients with history of atrial fibrillation or syncope."
3122,Medical , Autism  , loneliness; social isolation; informal caregivers; qualitative interviews; experiences; United Kingdom        ,"Although providing care to a family member or friend may provide psychological benefits, informal (i.e., unpaid) caregivers also encounter difficulties which may negatively affect their quality of life as well as their mental and physical health. Loneliness is one important challenge that caregivers face, with this psychological state being associated with morbidity and premature mortality. Although previous research has identified loneliness as an issue associated with being an informal caregiver, there is a paucity of evidence that attempts to understand this phenomenon in depth. This study aimed to examine informal caregivers' reflections on, and accounts of, experiences of loneliness linked to their caregiving situation. As part of a cross-sectional, qualitative study, sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 spousal caregivers, 4 daughters caring for a parent, 3 mothers caring for a child (or children), and 1 woman looking after her partner. The cared-for persons were suffering from a range of mental and physical health conditions (e.g., dementia, frailty due to old age, multiple sclerosis, depression, autism). Data were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis. Experiences of loneliness were described by reference to a context of shrunken personal space and diminished social interaction caused by the restrictions imposed by the caregiving role. Loneliness was also articulated against a background of relational deprivations and losses as well as sentiments of powerlessness, helplessness, and a sense of sole responsibility. Social encounters were also seen to generate loneliness when they were characterized by some form of distancing. Though not all sources or circumstances of loneliness in caregivers are amenable to change, more opportunities for respite care services, as well as a heightened sensibility and social appreciation of caregivers' valued contributions could help caregivers manage some forms of loneliness."
3138,Medical , Autism  , autism; early intervention; treatment individualization; treatment combination        ,"Although several early intervention programs can be efficacious in improving outcomes of children with autism, treatment response is variable, leading most families to enroll their child in several interventions simultaneously. Because knowledge on the effects of combining different therapies is limited, it is critically important to develop and test predictions on how the ""active ingredients"" of different interventions interact with child characteristics and with one another when combined. An obstacle to this research agenda is the ""pre-paradigmatic"" stage of the autism early intervention field, in which many practices are organized around seemingly irreconcilable vocabularies. I argue that a formalization of the explanatory structures informing different treatments-based on the four parameters of logical coherence, falsifiability, parsimony, and consilience-can provide a conceptual lingua franca for the formulation of testable hypotheses on treatment individualization and combination, thus facilitating a more coherent and rational approach to research in this area."
3158,Medical , Autism  , disabilities; autism; college students; self-advocacy; social skills; universal design        ,"Although the challenges that autistic students face adapting to college are often pronounced, they are similar to the challenges that students with other disabilities face (e.g., difficulties with social interaction, self-advocacy, and executive functioning). However, extant evaluations of services for autistic college students are very limited despite an emerging literature examining supports for college students with a range of other disabilities. Given that many autistic students do not self-identify as autistic in college, and consequently might avoid autism-specific services, autistic students might benefit from services that are designed to support a broad range of neurodiverse students, or services that are structured according to the principles of Universal Design. In order to develop such services, we assessed the self-reported needs of autistic college students and their peers with other disabilities. Guided by needs assessments and feedback from students, we developed and evaluated two semesters of mentor-led group programming for autistic college students and students with other disabilities. The first semester of the program focused on social skills; after receiving feedback from participants, the curriculum for the second semester focused on self-advocacy. Participation in social-skills groups was associated with decreased anxiety and autism symptoms. Participation in self-advocacy groups was associated with increased perceived social support from friends, academic self-efficacy, and more accurate definitions of self-advocacy. This research suggests that supports for neurodiverse college students should be developed with their input and should include opportunities to engage with diverse peers."
3171,Medical , Autism  , Children; Autism; Eating behavior; Nutrient intake; Anthropometry; Egyptian        ,"Although the etiology and pathology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is still poorly understood, a number of environmental, anthropological, neurobiological and genetic factors have been related to the pathophysiology of ASD, even the impact of oxidative stress response related to the environment and nutrition intake. Usual recommended dietary habits are based on the combination of behavioral and dietary or nutraceutical interventions together with pharmacotherapy. Investigations about a reliable relationship between diet and ASD are still lacking. The present study aimed at comparing dietary regimens and habits of normally developing apparently healthy children, without diagnosed ASD, with a pediatric population of individuals affected by autistic disorder. Assessments of nutritional and anthropometric data, in addition to biochemical evaluation for nutrient deficiencies, were performed. A total of 80 children with autistic disorder and 80 healthy, normally developing pediatric individuals were enrolled in the study. Parents were asked to complete the standardized questionnaire regarding the different types of food and the proportion of a serving for their children. Biochemical analysis of micro- and macronutrients were also done. Plotting on the Egyptian sex-specific anthropometric growth (auximetric) chart, absolute weights as well as weight-related for age classes, were significantly higher in cases than healthy controls. No differences between groups were observed in regard to total kilocalories (kcal), carbohydrates, and fat intake. A total of 23.8% of children with autistic disorder vs. 11.3% in the healthy control group had a nutrient intake with features below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein. Children with autistic disorder showed low dietary intake of some micronutrients; calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), selenium (Se) and sodium (Na), also they had significantly high intake of potassium (K) and vitamin C compared to healthy controls. Serum Mg, Fe, Ca, folate and vitamin B12 in children with autistic disorder were significantly low compared with healthy children. Significant positive correlations between serum Mg, Fe, Ca, vitamin B12 and folate and their levels in food were present. These results confirmed that different nutritional inadequacy was observed in Egyptian children with autistic disorder. The evidence reported in the present study should recommend screening of the nutritional status of ASD children for nutrient adequacy to reduce these deficiencies by dietary means or by administering appropriate vitamin and mineral supplements. Nutritional intervention plan should be tailored to address specific needs."

The present study replicated and extended previous research on paraprofessional training, as well as assessed social validity. Our results suggest that (a) paraprofessionals can be trained to fidelity using a package consisting of lecture and performance feedback, (b) there are collateral gains for paraprofessionals following the training, (c) the social interactions between students with ASD and typically developing peers improve following paraprofessional training, and (d) there is strong social validity in regard to acceptability of the training program. Limitations and future directions are discussed."
1188,Medical , Skin Care  , photoaging; noninvasive facial rejuvenation; skin care; patient-directed facial rejuvenation        ,"A proper knowledge of noninvasive facial rejuvenation is integral to the practice of a cosmetic surgeon. Noninvasive facial rejuvenation can be divided into patient- versus physician-directed modalities. Patient-directed facial rejuvenation combines the use of facial products such as sunscreen, moisturizers, retinoids, alpha-hydroxy acids, and various antioxidants to both maintain youthful skin and rejuvenate damaged skin. Physicians may recommend and often prescribe certain products, but the patients are in control of this type of facial rejuvenation. On the other hand, physician-directed facial rejuvenation entails modalities that require direct physician involvement, such as neuromodulators, filler injections, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, and chemical peels. With the successful integration of each of these modalities, a complete facial regimen can be established and patient satisfaction can be maximized. This article is the first in a three-part series describing noninvasive facial rejuvenation. The authors focus on patient-directed facial rejuvenation. It is important, however, to emphasize that even in a patient-directed modality, a physician's involvement through education and guidance is integral to its success."

An invitation and link to an electronic survey were emailed to nurse managers of 91 maternal newborn units and NICUs in Ontario, Canada, and 40 completed surveys were submitted (44%). Results showed variable but infrequent use of pain reduction strategies. Barriers were coded as health care provider (HCP), infant, parent and organizational factors. Most barriers related to BF and SSC and included: preference to perform blood sampling without parents; parental preference to not be involved during blood sampling; unit cultures; out of date policies; insufficient time, knowledge and education; and staff being uncomfortable performing blood sampling with infants BF or held SSC.

Systematized sample preparation steps were developed according to product types. Various SPE cartridges and columns were examined to establish the condition of SPE and chromatographic separation for NDELA. Sample cleanup steps consisting of solvent and liquid-liquid extraction tailored to the various sample matrix types were established prior to mixed mode SPE (Bond Elut AccuCAT). Chromatographic separation was achieved within 7 min on a porous graphitic carbon (PGC) column using a gradient elution with the mobile phase of 1 mM ammonium acetate containing 0.1% acetic acid and methanol. NDELA was monitored using an electrospray positive ionization mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode (m/z 134.9 >103.7(quantifier) and 73.7(qualifier ion)) with d8-NDELA (m/z 143.1 >111.0) as internal standard. The standard curves were linear over the concentration range of 1-100 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.99. The limit of detection CLOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 10 and 20 mu g/kg, respectively (0.5 and 1 ng/mL in standard solution). The intra- and inter-day precisions were estimated to be below 11.1% and accuracies were within the range of 90.8-115.8%.

The cosmetics samples were firstly dispersed by water and subsequently extracted and purified using salting out-acetonitrile homogeneous extraction method. Finally, the extracting solution was concentrated by slow nitrogen gas blowing. All of the samples were separated by INNOWAX capillary chromatographic column, and detected by selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and quantified by isotope internal standard method. The method was validated for linearity and range, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Under the optimized condition, the calibration curves were linear over the selected concentration ranges of 2-500 mu g/L for all the thirteen analytes, with calculated coefficients of determination (R-2) of greater than 0.996. The limits of detection (LODs) and the limits of quantitation (LOQs) of the method were 3-15 mu g/kg and 10-50 mu g/kg, respectively. Recoveries were calculated at three levels of concentration spiked in two kinds of cosmetics (skin care cream and water). The values were found between 93.8% and 121.0% with relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 2.5-7.2% for intra-day precision (n = 6) and 3.3-6.7% for inter-day precision (n = 5).

Spinal dysraphism (ie, neural tube defects [NTD]) such as meningomyelocele is a risk factor for developing these ulcers in adults and pediatric patients. Information regarding the occurrence of trophic ulcers in pediatric patients with NTD is lacking. A review of the English-language literature on skin/neuropathic ulcers in patients with NTDs, irrespective of study design, published between 1975 and 2014, was undertaken using the PubMed database. Search terms included trophic ulcer, neuropathic ulcer, NTDs, and meningomyelocele. From among the more than 200 papers related to skin care in neonates and pediatric patients, 11 addressed skin ulcers in patients of NTD - 1 in French (a review article), 1 in German (a case report), and 9 in English (7 cohort studies and 2 reviewing surgical techniques). Typically, ulcers in patients with NTD are neuropathic (ie, related to nerve pathology). The most common type is meningomyelocele. Patients with NTD present with a spectrum of functional and sensory deficits that impair mobility; other causative factors that may contribute to the occurrence of ulcers include stress to the tissue, the length of time the stress occurs, muscle spasticity, infection, moisture, and nutritional status of the patient. Awareness of ulcer risk and preventive measures, such as maintaining foot flexibility or careful handling bony prominences such as kyphosis, is important. Once an ulcer occurs, management is challenging and involves collaboration of multiple medical, surgical, nutrition, and other specialists. If an ulcer develops and NTD has not been previously treated surgically or the MRI shows evidence of retethering, surgical treatment is needed. More research is needed to help guide ulcer prevention and treatment strategies in pediatric patients with NTD."
1779,Medical , Bipolar Disorder  , Age of onset; Agreement; Consistency; Recall; Reliability; Self-report        ,"Accurate age of onset (AOO) measurement is vital to etiologic and preventive research. While AOO reports are known to be subject to recall error, few population-based studies have been used to investigate agreement in AOO reports over more than a decade. We examined AOO reports for depression, back/neck pain, and daily smoking, in a population-based cohort spanning 29 years. A stratified sample of participants from Zurich, Switzerland (n = 591) completed a psychiatric and physical health interview 7 times between 1979, at ages 20 (males) and 21 (females), and 2008. We used one-way ANOVA to estimate intraclass correlations (ICCs) and weighted mixed models to estimate mean change over time and test for interactions with sex and clinical characteristics. Stratum-specific ICCs among those with 2 + reports were 0.19 and 0.29 for depression, 0.46 and 035 for back pain, and 0.66 and 0.75 for smoking. The average yearly increases in AOO report from the wave of first 12-month diagnosis or reported smoking, estimated in mixed models, were 0.57 years (95% confidence interval: 0.35, 0.79) for depression, 0.44 (95%CI: 0.28, 0.59) years for back pain, and 0.08 (95%CI: 0.03, 0.14) years for smoking. Initial impairment and frequency of treatment were associated with differences in average yearly change for depression. There is substantial variability in AOO reports over time and systematic increase with age. The degree of increase may differ by outcome, and for some outcomes, by participant clinical characteristics. Future studies should identify predictors of AOO report stability to ultimately benefit etiologic and preventive research. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
2052,Medical , Bipolar Disorder  , neuroimaging; endophenotypes; schizophrenia; biomarker        ,"Advances in functional brain imaging have improved the search for potential endophenotypic markers in schizophrenia. Here, we employed independent component analysis (ICA) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in resting state fMRI on a sample of 35 schizophrenia patients, 20 first-degree relatives and 35 control subjects. Analysis on ICA-derived networks revealed increased functional connectivity between the left frontoparietal network (FPN) and left temporal and parietal regions in schizophrenia patients (P < 0.001). First-degree relatives shared this hyperconnectivity, in particular in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG; P = 0.008). DCM analysis was employed to further explore underlying effective connectivity. Results showed increased inhibitory connections to the left angular gyrus (AG) in schizophrenia patients from all other nodes of the left FPN ( P < 0.001), and in particular from the left SMG (P - 0.001). Relatives also showed a pattern of increased inhibitory connections to the left AG (P = 0.008). Furthermore, the patient group showed increased excitatory connectivity between the left fusiform gyrus and the left SMG (P = 0.002). This connection was negatively correlated to inhibitory afferents to the left AG (P = 0.005) and to the negative symptom score on the PANSS scale (P = 0.001, r = -0.51). Left frontoparietotemporal dysfunction in schizophrenia has been previously associated with a range of abnormalities, including formal thought disorder, working memory dysfunction and sensory hallucinations. Our analysis uncovered new potential endophenotypic markers of schizophrenia and shed light on the organization of the left FPN in patients and their first-degree relatives.

2095,Medical , Bipolar Disorder  , event-related potential; depressive temperament; cyclothymic temperament; personality; arousal        ,"Affective temperaments are the subclinical manifestations or phenotypes of mood states and hypothetically represent one healthy end of the mood disorder spectrum. However, there is a scarcity of studies investigating the neurobiological basis of affective temperaments. One fundamental aspect of temperament is the behavioral reactivity to environmental stimuli, which can be effectively evaluated by use of cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) reflecting the diversity of information processing. The aim of the present study is to explore the associations between P300 and the affective temperamental traits in healthy individuals. We recorded the P300 ERP waves using an auditory oddball paradigm in 50 medical student volunteers (23 females, 27 males). Participants' affective temperaments were evaluated using the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego-auto questionnaire version (TEMPS-A). In bivariate analyses, depressive temperament score was significantly correlated with P300 latency (r(s) = 0.37, P < .01). In a multiple linear regression analysis, P300 latency showed a significant positive correlation with scores of depressive temperament ( = 0.40, P < .01) and a significant negative one with scores of cyclothymic temperament ( = -0.29, P = .03). Affective temperament scores were not associated with P300 amplitude and reaction times. These results indicate that affective temperaments are related to information processing in the brain. Depressive temperament may be characterized by decreased physiological arousal and slower information processing, while the opposite was observed for cyclothymic temperament."
2220,Medical , Bipolar Disorder  , major depressive episode; questionnaire; formal psychological assessment; symptomatology; psychopathology; quantitative-qualitative evaluation        ,"Aim : Major depressive episode (MDE) can manifest with different features. Discriminating between different types of MDEs is crucial for proper treatment. The aim of this study is to propose a new tool for MDE assessment in bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) to overcome some limitations of current rating scales. The proposed tool investigates all of the clinical features of different MDEs and gives qualitative information, differentiating patients with the same score but different symptoms and psychopathology severity. To achieve this purpose authors used a new methodology called Formal Psychological Assessment (FPA). FPA allows creating relations between the items of an assessment tool, and the set of diagnostic criteria of a given clinical disorder. In the application at hand, given the capability to analyze all clinical features, FPA appears a useful way to highlight and differentiate between inhibited and agitated depressive symptoms. Method : The new tool contains 41 items constructed through 23 clinical criteria from the DSM-5 and literature symptoms. In line with FPA, starting from a set of items and a set of clinical criteria, a Boolean matrix was built assigning to each item its own set of clinical criteria. The participants include 265 in the control group and 38 patients with MDE (diagnosed with MDD or BD) who answered the QuEDS. After 1 month, 63 participants performed the test again and 113 took the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale to analyze convergent-divergent validity. Results : The scale showed adequate reliability and validity. A hierarchical confirmatory factor analysis highlighted the presence of three sub factors (affective, somatic, and cognitive) and one high-order factor (depression). Conclusions : The new tool is potentially able to inform clinicians about the patients' most likely diagnostic configuration. Indeed, the clinical state of a patient consists of the subset of items he/she answered affirmatively, along with his/her subset of specific symptoms. Qualitative information is fundamental from a clinical perspective, allowing for the analysis and treatment of each patient according to his/her symptoms in an effective way."

Methods: We undertook a PubMed search updated to November 2014 incorporating search terms such as bipolar, mania, hypomania, ethic* (truncated), early intervention, prevention, genetic and family. Results: Fifty-six articles that were identified by this method as well as other relevant articles were examined within a framework of ethical principles including beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect for autonomy and justice. The primary risks associated with research and clinical interventions include stigma and labelling, especially among familial high-risk youth. Side effects from interventions are another concern. The benefits of preventive or early interventions were in the amelioration of symptoms as well as the possibility of minimizing disability, cognitive impairment and progression of the illness. Supporting the autonomy of individuals and improving access to stigma-free care may help moderate the potential challenges associated with the risks of interventions. Conclusions: Concerns about the risks of early identification and pre-onset interventions should be balanced against the potential benefits, the individuals' right to choice and by improving availability of services that balance such dilemmas."
677,Medical , Birth Control  , Affordable Care Act; Contraception; Mandate; Medicaid; Contraceptive access; Legal challenges        ,"A major goal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is reducing healthcare spending by shifting the focus of healthcare toward preventive care. Preventive services, including all FDA-approved contraception, must be provided to patients without cost-sharing under the ACA. No-cost contraception has been shown to increase uptake of highly effective birth control methods and reduce unintended pregnancy and abortion; however, some institutions and corporations argue that providing contraceptive coverage infringes on their religious beliefs. The contraceptive coverage mandate is evolving due to legal challenges, but it has already demonstrated success in reducing costs and improving access to contraception."
715,Medical , Birth Control  , sexual revolution; the Pill; history of sexuality; contraception; women's movement        ,"A method of birth control often called 'revolutionary' was implemented in many Western countries in the 1960s. The contraceptive pill allowed women to engage in sexual experiences without the permanent fear of pregnancy. This safe method was especially important for the group of unmarried or newlywed women who were in the middle of their academic or vocational education and wanted to combine career and family life. In the 1970s, however, and especially under the influence of the Women's Liberation Movement, attitudes towards the Pill changed. It was no longer seen as an emancipation of female sexuality, but as an instrument of the on-going male domination of sexuality and society in general. According to this point of view, issues such as sexuality and contraception that had so far been regarded as 'private' became political. Women now directly linked their very personal intimate experiences and questions of power and gender relations in society, and this often meant stopping taking the Pill. This article examines the particular reasons for the shift in contraceptive behaviour in West Germany and England. It analyses the changing attitudes of feminist activists toward the Pill and their influence on women's decisions about birth control."
1228,Medical , Birth Control  , Oestrus; menstrual cycle; facial sexual dimorphism; attractiveness; reproductive strategies        ,"A recent and controversial hypothesis suggests the presence of an oestrus phase in women as in other mammals. This implies that women: at their optimal fertility point of the menstrual cycle exhibit behaviors focused to maximize the genetic quality of their offspring. Several studies support this hypothesis, finding that women in the fertile phase tend to prefer men with traits associated to phenotypic quality, such as greater facial masculinization and symmetry. We experimentally tested some of the observations supporting this hypothesis in a population of 810 young Spanish women. We analyzed whether the preference for masculinized male faces is affected by i) the phase of the menstrual cycle, having a stable partner and the use of birth control pills. We could not reproduce the effect of the first two factors, but we found that women using hormonal contraceptives tend to prefer men with less masculine faces. These results indicate that some of the evidences supporting the oestrus hypothesis in humans must be reviewed, incorporating data from different socio-cultural and ethnic populations."

Best practices in adolescent anticipatory guidance and screening include a sexual health history, screening for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, counseling, and if indicated, providing access to contraceptives. Pediatricians' long-term relationships with adolescents and families allow them to help promote healthy sexual decision-making, including abstinence and contraceptive use. Additionally, medical indications for contraception, such as acne, dysmenorrhea, and heavy menstrual bleeding, are frequently uncovered during adolescent visits. This technical report provides an evidence base for the accompanying policy statement and addresses key aspects of adolescent contraceptive use, including the following: (1) sexual history taking, confidentiality, and counseling; (2) adolescent data on the use and side effects of newer contraceptive methods; (3) new data on older contraceptive methods; and (4) evidence supporting the use of contraceptives in adolescent patients with complex medical conditions."

Providing confidential contraceptive services to adolescents is important in reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy. Long-acting contraception such as the intrauterine device and contraceptive implant are recommended as first-line contraceptives for adolescents because they are highly effective with few side effects. The use of barrier methods to prevent sexually transmitted infections should be encouraged. Adolescents have limited knowledge of reproductive health and contraceptive options, and their sources of information are often unreliable. Access to contraception is available through a variety of resources that continue to expand."

In order to evaluate factors possibly associated with children's health, the health monitoring units have been established since 2004 in six study regions in Bavaria, Germany. The second health monitoring survey, implemented in 2005-06, focuses on the mental health status of preschool children. The goal of this study is (1) to examine the association of sociodemographic and environmental factors with mental health and (2) to analyze the applicability of the results of the health monitoring units to all preschool children in Bavaria by calculating weighting factors. Methods: Data on 6206 preschool children are available. Logistic regression analysis is applied to analyze possible associations with mental health. A weighting method is applied to correct for deviances compared to the whole population of preschool children in Bavaria (N =132,783). Results: 11% of preschool children show mental health problems. Regarding different indicators of sociodemographic status, low household income [unadjusted OR 3.34, 95% CI: 2.23-4.98] shows the strongest association of mental health problems. Non-accessibility of green space [unadjusted OR 2.74, 95% CI: 1.87-4.00] is also strongly associated with mental health. The results of the unweighted and weighted analysis are similar. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that sociodemographic status and factors in the living environment show associations with mental health of children. Based on the results of the unweighted and weighted analyses, the second health monitoring analysis shows little deviances compared to data of all Bavarian preschool children. Therefore, the results can be compared to all Bavarian preschool children. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."
2511,Medical , Children's Health  , child; home; management; paediatric; pain; parent        ,"Aims and objectives. To understand parents' experiences of managing their child's postoperative pain at home. Background. Recent changes in children's health care services often shift the responsibility of managing children's postoperative pain to parents. Although pain management is important for good postoperative outcomes, it can be a challenging task for families, and children's pain is often under-managed. Design. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore parents' experiences of managing their child's postoperative pain at home. Methods. Participants were parents of 10 typically developing 5- and 6-year olds, who underwent (adeno) tonsillectomy, and experienced no complications leading to hospitalisation in the postoperative period. One-on-one interviews were conducted with parents within three months of their child's surgery. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and content analysis was used to identify themes in parents' experiences. Results. All children experienced some postoperative pain. Parents' experiences of managing their child's pain were impacted by balancing the pros and cons of administering analgesic medications, managing the emotional and psychological effects of their child's pain, as well as parents' information needs. Conclusions. Most parents' information needs were met yet they still struggled to manage their child's pain. These findings provide insight into some of the barriers that make this process challenging for many families, and what health care centres can do to help support parents manage their child's postoperative pain at home. Relevance to clinical practice. The results of this study may aid in the design of interventions that will support parents when managing their child's postoperative pain at home and thus improve children's experiences."
2647,Medical , Children's Health  , Parents; substance abuse; children's health; register data        ,"Aims: This study looks at the connection between parents' substance abuse and their 0-6 years old children's somatic and psychological health. Methods: A retrospective population-based cohort study based on Finnish health care and social welfare registers. The participants were all children born in Finland in 1997 (N=58,667) and 2002 (N=55,146) and their biological parents. Children were followed up for hospitalisations because of injuries, somatic illness and psychiatric disorders. The association between hospitalisations and parents' substance abuse as well as living with the abusing parent were estimated using logistic regression. Findings: Children's hospitalisations for all reasons were more prevalent if the mother or the father had a substance abuse problem. Mother's substance abuse increased the children's risk of hospitalisations for somatic illness (OR=1.34) and psychiatric disorders (OR=1.33, father's substance abuse increased the risk of hospitalisation because of psychiatric disorders (OR=1.18). The risks were even higher if both parents were substance abusers. Conclusions: Parents' substance abuse can cause a variety of harms to children, which may be related to unsafe environment, long-standing stress, and non-adequate responding to the child's needs. Multi-professional work with substance abusing parents and their children is crucial in order to reduce children's risks for poor health."

This study aims to investigate nocturnal sleep duration, sleep pattern and their relationships with outdoor play and screen time among children aged 2 to five years. MethodsThe study used data from the Healthy Beginnings Trial undertaken in Sydney, Australia. Data on children's sleep, outdoor playtime and screen time were reported by mothers via face-to-face interviews when children were 2, 3.5 and five years old. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted. ResultsAt age 2, 3.5 and five years, 497, 415 and 369 mother-child dyads participated. Significantly, there was an overall increase in children's nocturnal sleep duration, sleep latency and an earlier bedtime, and there was a decrease in the proportion of children who woke at night over time. Each additional hour of screen time was associated with three-minute (95% CI 0.6-5) shorter sleep, 1.6-minute (95% CI 0.59-2.63) longer sleep latency, four-minute (95% CI 1.8-6.0) later bedtime and less likely sleeping 10hours per night with adjusted odds ratio 0.88 (95% CI 0.77-1.00), after controlling for mothers' demographics. ConclusionAmong young children, screen time and outdoor playtime were associated with sleep duration and pattern. Reducing screen time and increasing outdoor playtime might help improving children's sleep."

MethodsDietary intakes of 54 children (50% girls) aged two to three years (mean 2.7 years) from the Women and Their Children's Health (WATCH) study were reported by mothers using a validated 120-item food frequency questionnaire. Daily consumption of AGHE food group servings, macronutrients, and micronutrients were compared to the AGHE and NRVs using t-test with significance set at P < 0.05. ResultsNo child achieved all AGHE targets, with the majority consuming less breads/cereals (1.9 vs 4.0 servings/day), vegetables (1.3 vs 2.5), and meat/alternatives (0.7 vs 1.0), all P < 0.0001. Adequate servings were observed for dairy (2.2 vs 1.5) and fruit (1.3 vs 1.0). Macronutrients were within recommended ranges, although 96% exceeded saturated fatty acid recommendations. Children who met selected NRVs consumed more fruit (1.4 vs 1.0; P < 0.0086), dairy (2.2 vs 1.5; P < 0.0001) and discretionary foods (2.6 vs 1.0; P < 0.0001) but less breads/cereals (2.0 vs 4.0; P < 0.0001) and vegetables (1.3 vs 2.5; P < 0.0001) servings, compared to the AGHE recommended servings. ConclusionsChild dietary intakes did not align with AGHE, while adequate nutrient profiles were achieved by various dietary patterns. Future studies involving data from larger, representative samples of children are warranted."

A laparoscopic approach offers potentially improved outcomes. The aim of the study was to report our experience with STC for UC in a single large centre. Method From January 2007 to May 2015, all consecutive patients undergoing STC for UC were retrospectively analysed from a prospectively managed database. Patients with known Crohn's disease or those undergoing one-stage procedures were excluded. Demographics, perioperative outcomes and second-stage procedures were analysed. Results During the study period, 151 STCs were performed for UC [100 emergency (66%) and 51 elective (34%)]. Acute severe colitis refractory to therapy was the most common indication (62%). Overall, 117 laparoscopic (78%) and 34 open STCs were performed, with a conversion rate of 14.5%. Mortality and morbidity rates were 0.7% and 38%, respectively. Whilst operative time was shorter for open STC (by 75 min; P = 0.001), there were fewer complications (32% vs 62%; P = 0.002) and a shorter hospital stay (by 6.9 days; P = 0.0002) following laparoscopic STC. Fewer complications and shorter hospital stay were also observed after elective STC. Patients undergoing laparoscopic STC were more likely to undergo a restorative second-stage procedure than those having open STC (75% vs 50%; P = 0.03). Conclusion Laparoscopic STC for UC is feasible and safe, even in the emergency situation. A laparoscopic approach may offer advantages in terms of lower morbidity and reduced length of stay. Elective resection may offer similar advantages and is best performed whenever possible."
2245,Medical , Crohn's Disease  , Crohn's disease; imaging; surgery        ,"Aim The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of imaging for measurement of the length of the ileocolic segment affected by Crohn's disease. Method Fifty-four consecutive patients who underwent resection between 2011 and 2014 for ileocolic Crohn's disease were prospectively studied. All had preoperative MR or CT enterography. Two independent radiologists measured the length of the diseased intestinal segment. The measurements were compared with the length of disease assessed on pathology of the non-fixed surgical specimen. Results The median preoperative length of the Crohn's disease segment on imaging was 20.5 (2-73) cm and 20 (3-90) cm, as measured by the two radiologists. Interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.69) with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.82 (P < 0.001). The median length of the Crohn's disease segment on pathological examination was 16.5 (2-75) cm and was closely correlated with the radiological measurement (r = 0.76, P < 0.001). The length of the Crohn's disease segment on imaging was correct to within 5 cm of the value on pathology. It was correct in 30 (55%) patients and was underestimated and overestimated in 6 (11.1%) and 18 (33.3%). A length of disease of less than 20 cm found on imaging in 26 patients was confirmed in 25 (96%) on pathology, whereas a length of more than 20 cm found on imaging in 28 patients was confirmed in 18 (64%) on pathology. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and overall accuracy of imaging for predicting a length of less than 20 cm were 71%, 95%, 96%, 64% and 79%. Conclusion Imaging accurately identifies the length of the ileocolic segment of Crohn's disease when it is 20 cm or less on pathological examination. In patients with more extensive disease, imaging tends to overestimate the length and should be interpreted with caution."

Method This is a prospective study including a consecutive series of 38 patients with Crohn's disease of the small bowel who underwent surgery at a specialized colorectal unit of a tertiary hospital. Preoperative magnetic resonance enterography was performed in all patients, following a homogeneous protocol, within the 3 months prior to surgery. A thorough exploration of the small bowel was performed during the surgical procedure; calibration spheres were used according to the discretion of the surgeon. The accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography in detecting areas affected by Crohn's disease in the small bowel was assessed. The findings of magnetic resonance enterography were compared with surgical and pathological findings. Results Thirty-eight patients with 81 lesions were included in the study. During surgery, 12 lesions (14.8%) that were not described on magnetic resonance enterography were found. Seven of these were detected exclusively by the use of calibration spheres, passing unnoticed at surgical exploration. Magnetic resonance enterography had 90% accuracy in detecting the location of the stenosis (75.0% sensitivity, 95.7% specificity). Magnetic resonance enterography did not precisely diagnose the presence of an inflammatory phlegmon (accuracy 46.2%), but it was more accurate in detecting abscesses or fistulas (accuracy 89.9% and 98.6%, respectively). Conclusion Magnetic resonance enterography is a useful tool in the preoperative assessment of patients with Crohn's disease. However, a thorough intraoperative exploration of the entire small bowel is still necessary."

METHODS This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the First Department of Pediatrics of the University of Athens at the ""Aghia Sophia"" Children's Hospital. Children diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), who were followed as outpatients or during a hospitalization, participated, after informed consent was obtained from their legal representative. QOL was assessed by the IMPACT-III questionnaire. Demographic data and disease characteristics were also collected. Statistical analyses included parametric (Student's t-test and Pearson's r) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's test and Spearman's rho) procedures. RESULTS Ninety-nine patients (UC: 37, 73.0% females, CD: 62, 51.6% females), aged 12.8 +/- 2.6 years were included. Overall, as well as, sub-domain scores did not differ between UC and CD (overall score: 73.9 +/- 13.3 vs 77.5 +/- 11.2, respectively, p = 0.16). In the entire sample, total score was related to physician's global assessment (PGA, patients classified as ""mild/moderate"" active disease had, on average, 14.8 +/- 2.7 points lower total scores compared to those "" in remission"", p < 0.001) and age at IMPACT completion (Pearson's r = 0.29, p = 0.05). Disease activity assessed by the indices Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis activity index, Pediatric Crohn's disease activity index or PGA was significantly associated with all subdomains scores. Presence of extraintestinal manifestations had a negative impact on emotional and social functioning domains. CONCLUSION Disease activity is the main correlate of QOL in children with IBD, underlining the importance of achieving and sustaining clinical remission Key words: Inflammatory"
2260,Medical , Crohn's Disease  , Magnetic resonance imaging; Systemic inflammation; Fatigue; Crohn's disease; Cognition        ,"AIM To evaluate brain involvement in quiescent Crohn's disease (CD) patients with fatigue using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS Multiple MRI techniques were used to assess cerebral changes in 20 quiescent CD patients with fatigue (defined with at least 6 points out of an 11-point numeric rating scale compared with 17 healthy age and gender matched controls without fatigue. Furthermore, mental status was assessed by cognitive functioning, based on the neuropsychological inventory including the different domains global cognitive functioning, memory and executive functioning and in addition mood and quality of life scores. Cognitive functioning and mood status were correlated with MRI findings in the both study groups. RESULTS Reduced glutamate + glutamine (Glx = Glu + Gln) concentrations (P = 0.02) and ratios to total creatine (P = 0.02) were found in CD patients compared with controls. Significant increased Cerebral Blood Flow (P = 0.05) was found in CD patients (53.08 +/- 6.14 mL/100 g/min) compared with controls (47.60 +/- 8.62 mL/100 g/min). CD patients encountered significantly more depressive symptoms (P < 0.001). Cognitive functioning scores related to memory (P = 0.007) and executive functioning (P = 0.02) were lower in CD patients and both scores showed correlation with depression and anxiety. No correlation was found subcortical volumes between CD patients and controls in the T1-weighted analysis. In addition, no correlation was found between mental status and MRI findings. CONCLUSION This work shows evidence for perfusion, neurochemical and mental differences in the brain of CD patients with fatigue compared with healthy controls."

Our study aims to investigate the relationship between ARHL and the prevalence, and 10-year incidence of dementia in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We selected patients diagnosed with ARHL from the NHIRD. A comparison cohort comprising of patients without ARHL was frequency-matched by age, sex, and co-morbidities, and the occurrence of dementia was evaluated in both cohorts. The ARHL cohort consisted of 4108 patients with ARHL and the control cohort consisted of 4013 frequency-matched patients without ARHL. The incidence of dementia [hazard ratio (HR), 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI 1.14-1.49); P = 0.002] was higher among ARHL patients. Cox models showed that being female (HR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.07-1.68), as well as having co-morbidities, including chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, head injury, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, alcohol abuse/dependence, and tobacco abuse/dependence (HR, 1.27; 95% CI 1.11-1.45), were independent risk factors for dementia in ARHL patients. We found ARHL may be one of the early characteristics of dementia, and patients with hearing loss were at a higher risk of subsequent dementia. Clinicians should be more sensitive to dementia symptoms within the first 2 years following ARHL diagnosis. Further clinical studies of the relationship between dementia and ARHL may be necessary."

However, the relative effects of dementia on these factors are unknown. We investigated variability in behavioral independence and disturbance profiles of patients with dementia. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional correlation study in which 70 inpatients with dementia from convalescent wards in a hospital were enrolled. We assessed cognitive impairments with the Mini-Mental State Examination, evaluated behavioral independence levels with the Functional Independence Measure and assessed frequency of behavioral disturbances with the Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale. ResultsCoefficient determination was 0.395 (P<0.0001) between the Mini-Mental State Examination and Functional Independence Measure scores, 0.261 (P<0.0001) between the Mini-Mental State Examination and Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale scores, and 0.355 (P<0.0001) between the Functional Independence Measure and Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale scores. The most easily accomplished behavioral independence was eating, and the hardest was transfer to tub/shower. The behavioral disturbance with the highest frequency was urinary incontinence, and the lowest was emptying drawers or closets. ConclusionsModerate correlations were found between severity of dementia and behavioral independence levels and frequencies of behavioral disturbances. There were both easier and harder to accomplish behaviors, and both higher and lower frequencies of behavioral disturbances. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 605-613."
2454,Medical , Dementia  , cognitive function; education; mastery; vegetables and fruits        ,"AimDementia and cognitive impairment are important public health challenges to a rapidly aging country. The present study aimed to explore the protective factors against cognitive decline among community-dwelling middle-aged and older people from health, social, and lifestyle perspectives. MethodsData of the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study, a population-based cohort study in Taiwan, were retrieved for the study. Overall, 676 participants with intact baseline cognitive function (measured by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) were enrolled and followed for six years. Any increasing score of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire in the observational period was referred to as cognitive function decline. Associated factors for cognitive decline were identified by the logistic regression model. ResultsAmong all participants, 205 (30%) experienced cognitive decline during the study period. Crude logistic regression showed that women (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.6), low educational level (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-3.0) and low mastery (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9) were associated with cognitive decline, but no daily consumption of vegetables and fruits had only a marginal association (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.8). In the fully adjusted logistic regression analysis, old age, women, low educational level and low sense of mastery were independent predictors for cognitive decline. Participants with two modifiable factors (mastery, and daily consumptions of vegetables and fruits) had a lower risk of cognitive decline (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9), compared with those without any protective factor. ConclusionsParticipants with a better educational level, better personal mastery, and more consumption of fruits and vegetables were less likely to experience cognitive decline. An intervention study combining these features should be carried out to promote better cognitive health in communities. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017: 17 (Suppl. 1): 20-27."
2484,Medical , Dementia  , behavioral and psychotic symptoms of dementia; dementia; non-pharmacological intervention        ,"AimOur previous work showed that non-pharmacological interventions could effectively reduce the severity of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), while the factors influencing the effect of intervention were less explored. Therefore, the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the predictors of the non-pharmacological intervention effect for old veterans with dementia and BPSD. MethodsA total of 141 old veterans with dementia living in two veterans' homes in northern Taiwan were recruited. The participants received an organized non-pharmacological intervention program of physical activity/exercise, music therapy, reality orientation, art therapy, reminiscence therapy and horticultural therapy once every week for 6months. All participants were evaluated by the Barthel Index, Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI), and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia before and after the intervention. Logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with improvement/maintenance of cognition (measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination), and improvement of BPSD (measured by NPI) and its subdomains during the intervention period. ResultsMultivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the improvement/maintenance of cognitive function was independently associated with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.97, P=0.008), whereas participants with antipsychotic use were less likely to gain the effect (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.17-1.04, P=0.061). In addition, the improvement of BPSD was associated with a higher baseline total NPI score (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15-1.55, P<0.001), and the result was consistent in different NPI subdomains (psychotic domain: OR 1.96, 95% CI 0.83-4.58, P=0.123; affective domain: OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.25-2.13, P<0.001; behavior domain: OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.53-3.30, P<0.001) and caregiver burden (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.24-2.14, P<0.001). In addition, a higher Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia score was correlated with an improvement in the NPI behavior domain (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.01-2.18, P=0.047), whereas participants with hearing impairment had a lower chance of improvement in the NPI behavior domain (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-1.23, P=0.073) and care burden (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03-0.99, P=0.050). ConclusionsOur findings show that non-pharmacological intervention programs have a significant effect on reducing overall NPI score, NPI caregiver burden score and NPI subdomains - psychotic, affective and behavior syndrome - in old veterans with dementia. In addition, participants with lower cognitive performance, more severe BPSD and depressive symptoms at baseline were more likely to gain benefit from the intervention, whereas antipsychotic use and hearing impairment were negative predictors of improvement of cognition and BPSD, respectively.

2504,Medical , Dementia  , dementia; emergency department; older care; pain assessment; qualitative study        ,"Aims and objectives. To explore emergency nurses' perceptions of the feasibility and utility of Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia tool in people over 65 with cognitive impairment. The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia tool was then compared with The Abbey Pain Scale, Doloplus-2 and PACSLAC. The objective was to determine which observational pain assessment tool was the most appropriate for the emergency department context and the cognitively impaired older person. Background. The number of older people with cognitive impairment conditions, such as dementia, presenting to the emergency department is increasing. Approximately 28% of people over 65 years who present will have cognitive impairment. Older people with cognitive impairment often receive suboptimal pain management in the ED. There is limited evidence of the use and/or appropriateness of dementia-specific pain observation assessment tools in the ED. Design. This was a multicentre exploratory qualitative study, which was conducted within a constructivist paradigm. Methods. Focus group interviews were conducted with nurses across three hospital emergency departments. Data were subject to thematic analysis. Results. Six focus groups were conducted with 36 nurses over a 12-week period. Four themes emerged from the analysis: 1) cognitive impairment is a barrier to pain management; 2) PAINAD gives structure to pain assessment; 3) PAINAD assists to convey pain intensity; and 4) selection of an appropriate observational pain assessment tool. Conclusions. This study identified that emergency nurses find it challenging to detect, assess and manage pain in cognitively impaired people. While the use of the PAINAD helped to address these challenges compared to other tools, nurses also identified the important role that family and carers can play in pain assessment and management for older people with cognitive impairment. Relevance to clinical practice. This study has generated new knowledge that has broad application across clinical settings, which can assist to transform pain management practice and reduce human suffering. The use of an observational pain assessment tool can provide for greater practice consistency for patients with communication difficulties. Pain management for older people with cognitive impairment is best achieved by the use an appropriate observational pain assessment tool and with a multidisciplinary approach that includes the person and their family/carer."
1875,Medical , Diabetes  , Casein kinase 2 alpha subunit; Diabetic nephropathy; NF-kappa B pathway; Renal fibrosis; TBB treatment        ,"Activation of casein kinase 2 (CK2) is closely linked to the body disturbance of carbohydrate metabolism and inflammatory reaction. The renal chronic inflammatory reaction in the setting of diabetes is one of the important hallmarks of diabetic renal fibrosis. However, it remains unknown whether CK2 influences the process of diabetic renal fibrosis. The current study is aimed to investigate if CK2 alpha ameliorates renal inflammatory fibrosis in diabetes via NF-kappa B pathway. To explore potential regulatory mechanism of CK2 alpha, the expression and activity of CK2 alpha, which were studied by plasmid transfection, selective inhibitor, small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and adenovirus infection in vitro or in vivo, were analyzed by means of western blotting (WB), dual luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The following findings were observed: (1) Expression of CK2 alpha, was upregulated in kidneys of di:0:lb and KKAy diabetic mice; (2) Inhibition of CK2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of CK2 alpha protein expression suppressed high glucose-induced expressions of FN and ICAM-1 in glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs); (3) Inhibition of CK2 alpha kinase activity or knockdown of CK2 alpha protein expression not only restrained hcB degradation, but also suppressed HG-induced nuclear accumulation, transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity of NF-kappa B in GMCs; (4) Treatment of TBB or CK2 alpha RNAi adenovirus infection ameliorated renal fibrosis in diabetic animals; (5) Treatment of TBB or CK2 alpha RNAi adenovirus infection suppressed hcB degradation and NF-kappa B nuclear accumulation in glomeruli of diabetic animals. This study indicates the essential role of CK2 alpha in regulating the diabetic renal pathological process of inflammatory fibrosis via NF-kappa B pathway, and inhibition of CK2 alpha may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic nephropathy.

2029,Medical , Diabetes  , Breast cancer; Estrogen receptor; Tamoxifen; Chemotherapy; Advanced glycation end products; Carboxymethyl lysine        ,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate as a result of high concentrations of reactive aldehydes, oxidative stress, and insufficient degradation of glycated proteins. AGEs are therefore accepted biomarkers for aging, diabetes, and several degenerative diseases. Due to the Warburg effect and increased oxidative stress, cancer cells frequently accumulate significant amounts of AGEs. As the accumulation of AGEs may reflect the metabolic state and receptor signaling, we evaluated the potential prognostic and predictive value of this biomarker. We used immunohistochemistry to determine the AGE N epsilon-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) in 213 mammary carcinoma samples and Western blotting to detect AGEs in cell cultures. Whereas no significant correlation between hormone receptor status and CML was observed in cell lines, CML accumulation in tumors was positively correlated with the presence of estrogen receptor alpha, the postmenopausal state, and age. A negative correlation was found for grade III carcinomas and triple-negative cases. In a retrospective Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, there was a statistical trend that high CML accumulation correlated with a more favorable prognosis (relapse-free survival, RFS) under tamoxifen treatment (p = 0.1). In estrogen receptor-negative cases, the high CML content was significantly correlated with an unfavorable outcome (RFS) of chemotherapy (p = 0.046). CML is a therefore a potentially predictive marker for the treatment of breast cancer patients with tamoxifen or chemotherapy."

They are suggested to be caused by an age-related decline in immune system functioning (immunosenescence) and a low-grade chronic inflammation (inflammaging), which accompany many aging-associated pathologies. The microbiota-targeted dietary and probiotic interventions have been shown to favorably affect the host health and aging by an enhancement of antioxidant activity, improving immune homeostasis, suppression of chronic inflammation, regulation of fat deposition and metabolism and prevention of insulin resistance. Recently, a high effectiveness and safety of novel therapeutic application such as fecal microbiota transplantation in the prevention and treatment of age-related pathological conditions including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease has been demonstrated. In this review, recent research findings are summarized on the role of gut micribiota in aging processes with emphasis on therapeutic potential of microbiome-targeted interventions in anti-aging medicine.

To determine which specific groups of occupational stress factors influence the duration of temporary work disability related to arterial hypertension and joint complications/co-morbidities. Methodology. Workers (n=1398; 1009 in the exposed group, 389 in the control group) with arterial hypertension who worked at one workplace for a minimum of 10 years were divided into 10 subgroups, depending on the presence of joint complications/co-morbidities. The intensity of seven groups of occupational stress factors, the total score of Occupational Stress Index (OSI) and the average number of lost working days during 1 year were analysed. Results. The number of lost working days due to arterial hypertension and joint complications/co-morbidities was significantly higher in the exposed group. In all subgroups of the exposed group there was a high correlation between the number of lost working days and the total OSI score. Specific occupational stress factors were associated with specific complications: High Demands with chronic myocardial infarction, Strictness with cerebral haemorrhage, Conflict/Uncertainty with cerebral infarction, Extrinsic Time Pressure with acute myocardial infarction, and Avoidance/Symbolic Aversiveness with non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Conclusion. There are specific groups of occupational stress factors which can influence the duration of work disability associated with certain complications and co-morbidities of arterial hypertension."
2329,Medical , Diabetes  , Irisin; Physical activity; Macrophage; Phagocytosis; Inflammation; Immune responses        ,"Aim: Irisin, the adipomyokine, released mainly by exercised muscles, participate in the browning of adipose tissue and contribute to the restriction of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus 2 development. Because of the limited reports describing the effect of irisin on inflammation and immunocompetent cells activation, the present study attempted to assess the influence of various irisin concentrations on basic macrophage activity. Main methods: Studies were carried out on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages cultured in medium enriched with irisin (0 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM, or 100 nM). General cell activity, viability, and proliferation were assessed along with phagocytosis process, and respiratory burst generation. Key finding: Irisin level positively correlates with general cell activity and cell cycle progression as well as with phagocytosis intensity, but negatively correlates with the intensity of respiratory burst generation. No influence of irisin on quiescent cell viability, including apoptosis or necrosis, was observed. Significance: This research is the first to show that irisin modulates macrophage activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, which could suggest its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, further studies are needed for the evaluation of influence of irisin on immunocompetent cell function. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
872,Medical , Weight Loss  , Treated kaolin material; Construction; Carbon dioxide storage; Clay; EGR and EOR        ,A new material from clay was developed that has a resistance to carbon dioxide flow in upstream for plugging CO2 storage wells. Thermogravimetric and thermal stability of this material showed a minimal variation in weight loss with incremental heating up to 420 degrees C. Adsorption-desorption of CO2 at various modeled temperature showed an exothermic and spontaneous process with maximum adsorption capacity of 775 mg/g obtained at 640 psi (43.5 bar) and 50 degrees C. Higher pressure led to more storage capacity with physisorption hysteresis curves. Freundlich and BET models best fit the equilibrium adsorption data with average regression coefficient of 0.995. The new material can substitute the conventional cement plugs for upstream carbon sequestration and prevents the migration of the stored CO2 through the cement plug to the surface. Also the developed new cement showed no chemical interaction which confirms the economical impact of using this cement to plug the CO2 sequestrations wells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These compounds have been characterized by different physico-chemical and spectroscopic tools (UV Vis, IR, NMR and ESI-Mass). The molecular structure of Iabh is determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction technique. The ligand Iabh displays E-configuration about the >C=N- bond. The structure of ligand is stabilized by intra-molecular H-bonding. In all the metal complexes the ligand coordinates through azomethine-N and carbonyl-O resulting a distorted octahedral geometry for Mn(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) complexes in which chloride ions occupy axial positions. Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes, however, form 4-coordinate distorted square planer and tetrahedral geometry around metal ion, respectively. The structures of the complexes have been satisfactorily modeled by calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT (TD-DFT). The corrosion inhibition study of the compounds have been performed against mild steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at 298 M by using weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

The results from X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and analytical electron microscopy indicated the alkaline earth compounds were dispersed on the surface of Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 . The doped mixed oxides were evaluated in the catalytic reaction of solid coke under tight contact conditions with 10 vol.% O-2 in He at 693 K and with 100 vol.% H2O at 993 K using thermogravimetric analysis. For coke oxidation with O-2, the weight loss was first order in coke, and the measured first order rate constant was proportional to the total surface area of catalyst at low catalyst loadings. For coke gasification with H2O, the weight loss was nearly zero order in coke, and the measured areal reaction rate was independent of the total surface area of catalyst at low catalyst loadings. The addition of alkaline earth metals inhibited coke oxidation with dioxygen but promoted coke gasification with steam. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The influence of different monocarboxylic acids on the viscosities of polyesters and their 2K-PU films hardness was studied and it was found that MHPs prepared from lauric acid displayed the higher films hardness and lower viscosities. IR spectra of MHPs disclosed the ring-opening reaction between epsilon-caprolactone and hydroxyl groups occurred. H-1 NMR spectra demonstrated that the molecular structures of MHPs were irregular due to the multiplicity of reaction processes. The measured number-average molecular weights (M (n)) of MHPs were around 715-1854 g/mol with the PDI of 1.45-2.05. MHPs exhibited lower viscosities in the range of 3304-9060 mPa s at 100% solid contents and possessed lower intrinsic viscosities compared with linear polymers of similar molecular weight. The cured films of MHPs exhibited excellent impact resistance, adhesion, flexibility, and high hardness and displayed good thermal stability with 5% weight loss at 280A degrees C. The solution viscosities of MHPs were less than 450 mPa s at 80% solid contents, and the VOC contents of 2K-PU coatings obtained from MHPs were low to 300 g/L."

Methods and Results: Of the ten species tested, only Vibrio alginolyticus (NCIMB 1339) and Vibrio gazogenes (NCIMB 2250) showed antagonistic activity towards a panel of shrimp pathogenic vibrios. In the case of V. alginolyticus, this activity depended on the presence of live bacteria while in V. gazogenes both live and dead bacteria showed anti-Vibrio activity. Injection of shrimp with either V. alginolyticus or V. gazogenes at 3 x 107 or 3 x 105 total bacteria per shrimp resulted in mortality with higher levels in the case of V. alginolyticus (100% mortality 18 h postinjection of 3 x 107 bacteria). Juvenile shrimp were fed commercial diets top-coated with either chitin (an immune stimulant) or chitin + V. gazogenes. Both chitin and V. gazogenes caused a significant decline in the number of Vibrio-like bacteria in the fore and hind gut, and changes were also seen in the hepatosomatic index (a measure of digestive health) and the total number of blood cells in circulation. Analysis of mid/hindgut and faecal samples obtained using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism showed that the gut microbiota of shrimp has limited bacterial diversity and that after 8 weeks exposure to the experimental diets there were significant changes in the microbial flora of the GI tract of shrimp as a result of the presence of V. gazogenes. Conclusions: Of the vibrios tested, V. gazogenes has potential as a probiotic for the control of bacterial diseases in shrimp. Significance and Impact of the Study: Overall, this study shows the promise of V. gazogenes together with chitin to improve the health and welfare of shrimp under aquaculture conditions."

The experiment consisted in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two weaning ages (28 days vs. 42 days) and two levels of dietary neutral detergent fibre assayed with a heat stable amylase and expressed exclusive of residual ash (aNDFom; 330g/kg vs. 425g/kg). Controls were made during two consecutive experimental periods that differed in hygienic environmental conditions by modifying the intensity of cleaning and disinfection in the farm previous to the trial. An interaction (P<0.001) was detected among the independent variables studied on Cl. perfringens enumeration in the caecal contents, as minimal values for this trait were obtained in non-medicated animals reared in a clean environment, and especially when they were weaned at a later age and fed the diet with the lower fibre content. The treatments studied also led to a variation in fattening mortality(from 4.7% to 34.0%), which was highly and positively-correlated (P<0.001) to the average Cl. perfringens caecal counts in each combination of treatments. The results of the current study indicate that high Counts of Cl. perfringens in the caecum can be used as an indicator of Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy, and suggest that strategies designed to control its proliferation in the caecum might help to limit fattening mortality in rabbit fed diets not-medicated with antibiotics.

To overcome this, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) has evolved a range of anatomical and physiological adaptations to assist with digestion and absorption of nutrients from this food source. Microbial fermentation of partially digested eucalyptus leaves is thought to be critical in this process, however, little is known about the composition and diversity of microorganisms that are associated with digestive health in this native species. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing of caecum, colon and faecal pellet samples from two wild, free ranging, Queensland koalas. Our results reveal a highly complex and diverse ecosystem with considerable intra-individual variation. Although samples were dominated by sequences from the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla there was considerable variation at the genus level.

Methods and Study Design: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Budi Kemuliaan and Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta from 2013 to 2014. A total of 104 participants were randomly allocated to receive either completely enriched milk powder (intervention group) or iron- and vitamin folic-acid-enriched milk powder (control group). Data were collected using standardised measures and were statistically analysed using the independent t or Mann Whitney test. Results: At the baseline, the micronutrient status of the participants was acceptable, except for 25-OH-vitamin D, in both the intervention and control groups. Vitamin B-1, zinc, total free fatty acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and DHA were significantly higher in the intervention group in the second trimester (p=0.014, 0.028, 0.023, 0.014, 0.001, and 0.032, respectively). Interleulcin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels did not significantly vary during pregnancy. B. animalis subsp. lactis DR10(TM) was present in the faeces of the intervention group but not the control group (61.1% vs 0%). Conclusion: Milk fortified with a prebiotic, probiotic, DHA and micronutrients increases the faecal concentration of the organism used for fortification in Indonesian pregnant women. This may represent an improvement in intra-partum maternal gut health."

In particular, data are lacking from lactase deficient populations. This prospective cohort study assessed the prevalence of, and risk factors for, SLI in Chinese patients attending a gastroenterology clinic. Methods Consecutive patients completed questionnaires to assess digestive health (Rome III), psychological state (HADS), life event stress (LES), food intake, and quality-of-life (SF-8). A representative sample completed genetic studies and hydrogen breath testing (HBT) at the clinically relevant dose of 20 g lactose. Key Results SLI was present in 411/910 (45%) clinic patients with functional abdominal symptoms. The genotype in all subjects was C/C-13910. A small number of novel SNPs in lactase promoter region were identified, including C/T-13908 which appeared to confer lactase persistence. Over half of the patients (54%) completed the 20 g lactose HBT with 58% (285/492) reporting typical symptoms. Positive and negative predictive values of SLI for abdominal symptoms during HBT were 60% and 44%, respectively. Psychological state and stress were not associated with SLI in clinic patients. SLI impacted on physical quality-of-life and was associated with reduced ingestion of dairy products, legumes, and dried fruit (p = 0.05). Conclusions & Inferences In a lactase deficient population, approximately half of patients attending clinic with functional gastrointestinal symptoms reported intolerance to dairy products; however, SLI did not predict findings on 20 g lactose HBT. Independent of psychosocial factors, SLI impacted on quality-of-life and impacted on food choices with restrictions not limited to dairy products."

1990,Medical , Emergency Contraception  , serious game; sexuality education; student perception        ,"Adolescents in Hong Kong have become more liberal and receptive towards sex in recent decades. Research findings indicated an increase in the rate of premarital sex among Hong Kong adolescents. They also held a more permissive attitude towards premarital sex than in the past. Sex education, however, is not always well organised and delivered in schools. A recent survey indicated that Hong Kong teachers found themselves not well equipped to teach the sex education and lacked relevant learning and teaching resources. Current educational resources for sex education are mainly designed to be used in classroom. They are typically composed of presentation slides and lesson plans of group based activities. As discussion on sex is still taboo in Chinese society, self-learning resources can supplement classroom teaching. Unfortunately they are rarely offered online or tailored for mobile access. Available online resources are mostly text-based and are unattractive to the most vulnerable adolescent group. This project aims to address this gap by developing an interactive game playable on Facebook, iPad and the web to educate and equip young adolescents with reliable knowledge and positive attitudes towards sex and relationship and life skills necessary for making wise decisions regarding love and sex in a fun way. The game, titled Making Smart Choices, consists of five mini-games, adopting a Chinese user interface, offering different scenarios where players exact their decisions in their chosen virtual characters and learn in the process. The mini-games aim to help young adolescents: to gain better self-understanding for establishing a healthy love relationship; to learn to set and maintain intimate boundaries; to understand about sexual impulse and considerations in deciding whether to have sex or not; to acquire safer sex knowledge including awareness of selfprotection, contraceptives, prevention of sexually transmissible diseases, and emergency contraception; and to be aware of available options and support services in case of unplanned pregnancies. To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptance of the game among young adolescents, a series of workshops and game sessions were conducted for more than 1,100 junior students ( in Secondary 1 to Secondary 3) in six co-ed secondary schools. Students' knowledge about safer sex was collected before and after playing the game. Participants were also asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their perception of the value of the game and whether they found the game interesting and user-friendly. Focus group interviews were arranged with selected students in order to gather their detailed feedback. The collected data were analysed using SPSS and the results showed that after playing the game, students' sex knowledge improved with a high medium effect size. The improvement was found in every junior secondary level. The survey respondents perceived that the game had helped them enhance their critical thinking, decision-making and ability to seek help regarding matters related to love and sexuality in addition to knowledge and proper attitudes towards relationship and sex. They were mostly receptive to the game, finding it fun to play with and describing the content as ""interesting"", ""interactive"", ""informative"", ""close to reality"" and ""applicable""."

Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted in a Hungarian university hospital among women for whom ECP was prescribed after unprotected intercourse (n=940) as well as women who presented for the termination of pregnancy (n=1592) between January 1, 2005 and November 20, 2006. Their knowledge of ECP and their experience with and attitudes toward ECP use were targeted. Results: The availability of ECP was well known (87.9%), but it was still greatly underutilized: applied by only 13 of the 1592 women who resorted to abortion. Primarily, the ECP group consisted of those who experienced a condom failure significantly more often (odds ratio [OR]=4.1), followed by those cases where ECP applications was a consequence of not using any kind of contraception (OR=3.8). Fewer than one third (32%) of the abortion seekers had previously used ECP, and only one fifth knew how to obtain it. Appropriate awareness of ECP was influenced by information obtained from health-care providers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.93) or school education (AOR=1.82). Conclusions: More thorough education is needed to provide a deeper knowledge of ECP use during contraceptive counseling for women seeking abortion, including those contraceptive mishaps where unintended pregnancy can be prevented by ECP."

ATR clients choose which services will help to overcome barriers in their road to recovery, and a recovery consultant provides vouchers and helps link the client to these community resources. One of ATR's goals was to provide services to those involved in the criminal justice system in the hopes that addressing substance abuse issues could reduce subsequent criminal behaviors. This study examines this goal by looking at recidivism among a sample of clients in one state's ATR program who returned to the community after incarceration. Results suggest that there were few differential effects of service selections on subsequent recidivism. However, there are significant differences in recidivism rates among the agencies that provided ATR services. Agencies with more resources and a focus on prisoner reentry had better recidivism outcomes than those that focus only on substance abuse services."

Patients who are detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2007 can apply to the Mental Health Tribunal to decide whether they should be detained in a psychiatric hospital or be discharged. The Mental Health Tribunal has the power to discharge these patients after a hearing. Patients who lack capacity to apply to the tribunal are unable to have a tribunal hearing. The European Court has ruled that this is unfair to these patients. There needs to be a system in place to ensure that these patients get a tribunal hearing. Abstract Background In the UK, the Mental Health Tribunal is a long-established safeguard for patients detained under the Mental Health Act. This gives such patients an effective appeal mechanism to ensure legal protection of their liberty. This act contains sections that allow for civil detention in the case of mental disorder. The right to apply to the tribunal against such detention is underpinned by the right to liberty under Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Some patients with learning disabilities may lack capacity and the ability to challenge their detention. Method This article presents a case study of a woman with Down's syndrome and severe learning disabilities. Whilst this woman was detained under the Mental Health Act, she could have applied for a review of her detention to the Mental Health Tribunal within 14days. She did not do so because she lacked capacity to instruct solicitors. Subsequently, as a result of appeal, the case proceeded through English and European judicial review. Results The European Court of Human Rights, in the case of MH v UK (2013), has ruled that the appeals procedure for patients without capacity detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act is not compatible with Article 5(4) of the European Convention of Human Rights. The European Court has ruled that special procedural safeguards are required to enable this cohort of patients to exercise their rights guaranteed by Article 5(4). Conclusions Responsible clinicians [treating consultant psychiatrists] need to ensure that all patients detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act have an assessment of their capacity to apply to the tribunal. There need to be systems in place to alert hospital managers when a patient lacks capacity to apply for a tribunal. Hospital managers should request the Secretary of State to apply for a tribunal in these instances. Knowledge of this ruling is relevant to informing the practice of other interdisciplinary healthcare professionals working with such patients."

The concept of compassion is well documented in the healthcare literature but has received limited attention in mental health nursing. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? Mental health nurses struggle with defining compassion. The study, with its limitations, brings greater clarity to the meaning of compassion for community mental health nurses and NHS organizations. Mental health nurses need time to reflect on their provision of compassionate care. What are the implications for practice? The study has shown that compassion is important for NHS healthcare management, frontline mental health nurses and policy-makers in UK, and there is potential for sharing practice and vision across NHS organisations. Mental health nurses could benefit from training to facilitate their understanding of compassionate practices. Emphasis should be placed on the importance of self-compassion and how this can be nurtured from the secure base of clinical supervision. Abstract Introduction There is increasing emphasis in policy, research and practice in the UK and internationally on the importance of caring in health care. Compassion needs to be at the core of all healthcare professionals' practice. Recently, health care has received negative attention through media and government reports which cite a lack of compassion in care. Rationale The concept of compassion has received limited attention in community mental health nursing. Aim Based on data taken from semi-structured interviews with community mental health nurses, this paper aims to describe interpretations and perspectives of compassion to gain insight and development of its meaning. Method A naturalistic, interpretive approach was taken to the study. Semi-structured interviews with nine mental health nurses were analysed using Burnard's 14-step model of thematic analysis. Findings The research illuminates the complexity of compassion and how its practice impacts on emotional responses and relationships with self, patients, colleagues and the employing organization. Participants identified difficulties engaging with compassionate practice whilst recognizing it as a driving force underpinning provision of care. Implications for practice Mental health nurses need to be supported to work towards a greater understanding of compassionate care for clinical practice and the need for self-compassion."
1715,Medical , Mental Health  , emotional text analysis; handovers; mental health workers; organizational change; psychiatric residential care; staff representations        ,"Accessible summary What is known on the subject? There is a growing emphasis on communication as a result of the move towards the more inclusive approach associated with the community-based rehabilitation model. Therefore, more importance is attached to handovers. Besides ensuring transfer of information, handovers enhance group cohesion, socialize staff members to the practices of the service and capture its organizational culture. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? While handovers are mainly used for information transfer and to manage the services' daily routine, this paper offers an insight on how handovers can be conceived as valuable instruments to document cultural and organizational change. Only a limited amount of studies has focused on handovers in mental healthcare settings, and most of them only consider the perspectives of psychiatric nurses, while embracing a broader perspective, this paper provides valuable insights into the perspectives of various service providers. The overcoming of the dichotomy deficit-based vs. recovery-oriented model is possible if professionals use handovers to reflect upon their practice and the ways in which their cultural models are affected by the environmental context. What are the implications for practice? Handovers are valuable instruments to document organizational change. It would be important for psychiatric and rehabilitation facilities to keep track of the handover records over time as they may provide insightful information about cultural change and the transformations in the core values and beliefs held by professionals. Abstract Handovers assure a timely and correct information transfer while socializing workers to the service's culture; however, no study describes them as instruments to document organizational change and only a few have focused on psychiatric settings. Aim To investigate the change in the culture of an Italian psychiatric residential care home as perceived by its mental health workers (MHWs) over the course of two decades. Method Emotional text analysis (ETA) was used to analyse the MHWs' handovers completed from 1990 to 2011. Results The analysis generated four clusters and three main factors illustrating the change in the MHWs' representations of the residential care home and its occupants. The factors showed: (1) the shift from an individualistic, problem-focused view to an inclusive, community-based approach; (2) the presence of a descriptive as well as a specialized language; and (3) the presence of a double focus: on patients and professionals. Conclusions Handovers transcripts document the following changes: (1) a shift from a symptom-based to a recovery-oriented approach; (2) a modification of the MHWs values towards an holistic view of the patient; (3) a growing importance assigned to accountability, services integration and teamwork. The paper shows that handovers can be used diachronically to document organizational change."

Radiographs and computed tomography of this individual revealed extensive cartilage mineralization of the skull and cranial cervical vertebrae compared with diagnostic images of clinically healthy conspecifics. Gross necropsy and histopathologic examination revealed ossification and fibrosis of the cartilaginous matrix of the skull and cervical vertebrae with deep invasion by a pigmented hyphal fungus. There was no growth on fungal culture, but fungal polymerase chain reaction identified a DNA sequence compatible with Exophiala sp. (99%). Radiographs and computed tomography were helpful to determine a prognosis and course of action for this individual. This case emphasizes the need to include fungal infections as a differential diagnosis when evaluating elasmobranchs with abnormal swimming behaviors and mineralization of the skeletal structures."

This is a novel insect positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, which we named Riptortus pedestris virus-1 (RiPV-1) (GenBank accession no. KU958718). The genome of RiPV-1 consists of 10,554 nucleotides (nt), excluding the poly(A) tail, which contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) of 10,371 nt encoding a polyprotein (3456 aa) and flanked by 71 and 112 nt at the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR), respectively. RiPV-1 genome organization from the 5' end contains a consensus organization of picorna-like RNA virus helicase, cysteine protease, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), in addition to two putative structural proteins located at the 3' region and a poly (A) tail at the 3' end. The viral particles were approximately 30 nm in diameter with some dispersal distinctive surface projections. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp sequences, RiPV-1 was clustered in the unassigned insect RNA viruses with two other viruses, APV and KFV. These three viruses were suggested to constitute a new group of insect RNA viruses. RiPV-1 could be found in all stages of lab reared bean bugs and was detected abundantly in the thorax, abdomen, midgut and fat body, but not in the reproductive organs and muscle. Interestingly, RiPV-1 replication was increased dramatically in bean bugs 2-6 days after fungal infection. In conclusion, a novel insect RNA virus was found by NGS data assembly. This virus can provide further insight into the interaction between virus, fungus and the host. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Furthermore, A. malaccensis adapts to this infection by developing typical included phloem boundary within xylem tissues. Naturally synthesized agarwood requires a lengthy process of up to 30 years, which impedes its continuous production. Therefore, recent effort has been allocated to the elucidation of agarwood formation to stimulate its process rapidly. In this study, we artificially induced agarwood formation by injection and inoculation of cultivated Aquilaria malaccensis with four strains of Fusarium solani isolated from different places in Indonesia. The results showed that A. malaccensis responded differently upon wounding and fungal inoculations compared to healthy trees. All wounded and inoculated samples resulted in the formation of typical discoloration zone surrounding injection sites. Further anatomical observation revealed that both samples also developed included phloem structures in which resinous agarwood compounds were accumulated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the inoculated samples yielded some important agarwood compounds such as tridecanoic acid, alpha-santalol, and spathulenol, which were not present in both healthy controls and only wounded samples. Notably, one of the tested F. solani, strain Gorontalo displayed promising results as a candidate for artificially induced agarwood formation in A. malaccensis in terms of color, odor, and chemical constituents."

The adverse effects of dipyridamole and other stress agents have been evaluated. The aim of this research is to confirm the dynamic data on dipyridamole side effects during MPS. Methods: We collected data of 183 patients who underwent dipyridamole-induced stress MPS by retrospectively reviewing their clinical records, which included the severity of dipyridamole side effects in 3 min, 10 min, and 20 min after infusion. The incidence and severity at all three points, including the effect of age and gender, were obtained. Results: Adverse effects occurred in 96 patients (69.6%). The most frequent symptoms were dizziness (42.8%), chest tightness (24.6%), abdominal pain (18.1%), and headache (15.2%). Most symptoms were Grade 1 to 2, according to the grading system for common terminology criteria. The median duration of symptom persistence was 36 min, not significantly different among age and gender. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the adverse effects of dipyridamole were generally minimal and its duration was acceptable for clinical usage. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Methods: Current drinkers in Canada (n=565) recruited through zoompanel were asked about 13 past year hangover symptoms. These were explored through correlation with alcohol consumption, problems, treatment and other factors. Findings: Increased number of symptoms were associated with higher Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) problem score, perceived harm from drinking, younger age and flushing/blushing when drinking (Mean = 3.3 symptoms). Four patterns were found from latent class analysis; class 4 (43%) no symptoms; class 3 (13%) thirst, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting; class 2 (22%) thirst, tiredness and headache; and class 1 (21%) wide range. Class 1 was characterised by blushing when drinking, higher perceived harm and attempts to reduce drinking due to hangovers. Classes 1-3 were associated with heavier consumption; only class 3 compared with class 4 had lower drinking refusal self-efficacy. Conclusions: higher alcohol consumption and lower drinking refusal self-efficacy relate to more symptoms; however, a group with variable alcohol consumption did not experience hangovers. The link between problems, treatment and hangover was not clear from patterns of symptoms; symptom severity may be worth further investigation."

Materials and methods: The study included 39 older (mean age 67 +/- 5.9 years) and 36 younger (21.1 +/- 1.8 years) women. Tone, stiffness and elasticity of the UT and the SCM were measured by means of myotonometry (MyotonPRO) in lying and then, in sitting position. The results were compared using twoway analysis of variance. Results: Irrespective of the position, older women presented with significantly higher muscle tone, stiffness and elasticity than younger subjects (P < 0.05). In both groups, the transition from lying to sitting position resulted in a decrease (P0.05) of the SCM, and stimulated an increase in the tone, stiffness and elasticity of the UT (P < 0.05). The degree of changes in both study groups was similar, except from the absolute value of the UT elasticity, significantly higher increase in older women than in younger subjects (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Age contributes to an increase in the stiffness and tone of the UT and the SCM, as well as to a decrease in the elasticity of these muscles in female subjects. In contrast, age exerts only a slight effect on the mechanical properties of both muscles during transition from lying to sitting position. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study is to further explore the effects of leisure-time aerobic exercise and muscle-strength activity on sleep duration. Subjects and methods Data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey Sample Adult Public Use File are analyzed. Age, gender, region, race, smoking, drinking, stress and anxiety are considered as potential confounders. Univariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regression models are fitted to estimate the effects of aerobic exercise and muscle-strength activity on sleep duration. Results A total of 24,190 adults were eligible for our study. 6.7 % of them sleep 5 h/day or fewer, 27.6 % sleep 9 h/day or more, only 65.9 % sleep 7 or 8 h/day. In the fully adjusted models, reference to the lowest level of aerobic exercise quartiles (P-75 are 0.72 (95 %CI: 0.59-0.86), 0.66 (95 %CI: 0.55-0.79) and 0.60 (95 %CI: 0.49-0.74) for sleeping= 9 h, respectively. The fully adjusted models of muscle-strength activity show that compared with lowest level of muscle-strength activity, the ORs of excessive muscle-strength activity for sleeping= 9 h are 1.52 (95 %CI: 1.16-2.01) and 1.32 (95 %CI: 1.00-1.72). Conclusion Our findings suggest that high levels of leisure-time aerobic exercise play a protective role in healthy sleep, while the excessive muscle-strength activity might increase the risk of both extremely short and long sleep durations."

Background Sleep disturbance is an important factor of human health and well-being. Sleep disturbances tend to occur among infertile women during intrauterine insemination treatment. Although many studies have focused on the high percentage of somatic symptoms and psychological distress in infertile women associated with their treatment, few studies have investigated factors linked to their sleep disturbances. Design A cross-sectional study. Methods The study was conducted during the period of September 2010-January 2011 in a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Infertile women (n=117) who received assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination treatment completed a questionnaire. Demographic data, somatic symptoms, psychological distress and perceived sleep quality were collected. Results More than one-third (35%) of the infertile women reported having sleep disturbances. Their nausea symptoms and psychological distress were risk factors that contributed to sleep disturbance. Conclusions The variables of nausea and psychological distress significantly explained 30% of the sleep disturbances in the infertile women. The evaluation of nausea symptoms and/or psychological distress among infertile women is an important area of future research; such research should aim to identify the best compromise between infertility treatment and sleep quality. Relevance to clinical practice Clinical obstetrics and gynaecology nurses should develop strategies to help infertile women reduce their nausea symptoms and psychological distress during intrauterine insemination treatment to promote healthy sleep."

Methods: Data on morning masticatory muscle pain and sleep variables were obtained from visual analog scales and a second night of polysomnographic recordings. Nineteen normal control (CTRL) subjects were age-and sex-matched to 62 tooth-grinding SBr. Differences in sleep macrostructure (stage distribution and duration, number of sleep-stage shifts), number of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) events/hour, and EEG activity were analyzed blind to subject status. The influence of pain and gender in SBr and CTRL subjects was assessed with the Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney U test, two-sample t test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Low-intensity morning transient orofacial pain was reported by 71% of SBr, with no sex difference. RMMA event frequency was higher in SB than CTRL subjects (4.5/hour vs 1.3/hour; P < .001). SBr had fewer sleep-stage shifts, irrespective of sex or pain status. Female SBr had significantly lower theta and alpha EEG activity compared to female CTRL subjects (P = .03), irrespective of pain.

A national longitudinal survey was conducted between 2009 and 2011 using a random sample of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. One thousand and ninety veterans, from 50 states representing all military branches, completed 2 waves of data collection, 1 year apart (retention rate = 79%). The final sample resembled the U.S. military post 9/11 in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, geography, and service branch. Protective mechanisms in socioeconomic (money to cover basic needs, stable employment), psychosocial (resilience, perceiving control over one's life, social support), and physical (healthy sleep, no physical pain) domains were examined. We found these protective mechanisms predicted decreased aggression and violence at follow-up, particularly among higher risk veterans. Multivariable analyses confirmed that protective mechanisms lowered violence through their interaction with risk factors. This study identifies protective mechanisms related to decreased community violence in veterans and indicates that rehabilitation aimed at improving socioeconomic, psychosocial, and physical well-being has potential promise to reduce aggression and violence among veterans after returning home from military service."

However, little evidence has been reported for cause-specific mortality or nonurban areas. Here we assessed the impact of climate change on heat-related total and cause-specific mortality in both urban and rural counties of Jiangsu Province, China, in the next five decades. To address the potential uncertainty in projecting future heat-related mortality, we applied localized urban- and nonurban-specific exposure response functions, six population projections including a no population change scenario and five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and 42 temperature projections from 21 global-scale general circulation models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Results showed that projected warmer temperatures in 2016-2040 and 2041-2065 will lead to higher heat-related mortality for total non-accidental, cardiovascular, respiratory, stroke, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) causes occurring annually during May to September in Jiangsu Province, China. Nonurban residents in Jiangsu will suffer from more excess heat-related cause-specific mortality in 2016-2065 than urban residents. Variations across climate models and RCPs dominated the uncertainty of heat-related mortality estimation whereas population size change only had limited influence. Our findings suggest that targeted climate change mitigation and adaptation measures should be taken in both urban and nonurban areas of Jiangsu Province. Specific public health interventions should be focused on the leading causes of death (stroke, IHD, and COPD), whose health burden will be amplified by a warming climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Because it is a hormonally active diet, however, soya can also be endocrine disrupting, suggesting that intake has the potential to cause adverse health effects in certain circumstances, particularly when exposure occurs during development. Consequently, the question of whether or not soya phyto-oestrogens are beneficial or harmful to human health is neither straightforward nor universally applicable to all groups. Possible benefits and risks depend on age, health status, and even the presence or absence of specific gut microflora. As global consumption increases, greater awareness and consideration of the endocrine-disrupting properties of soya by nutrition specialists and other health practitioners is needed. Consumption by infants and small children is of particular concern because their hormone-sensitive organs, including the brain and reproductive system, are still undergoing sexual differentiation and maturation. Thus, their susceptibility to the endocrine-disrupting activities of soya phyto-oestrogens may be especially high. As oestrogen receptor partial agonists with molecular and cellular properties similar to anthropogenic endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A, the soya phyto-oestrogens provide an interesting model for how attitudes about what is synthetic' v. what is natural,' shapes understanding and perception of what it means for a compound to be endocrine disrupting and/or potentially harmful. This review describes the endocrine-disrupting properties of soya phyto-oestrogens with a focus on neuroendocrine development and behaviour."

Thus, this large population-based cohort investigated whether adiponectin at baseline and/or a decrease in adiponectin during follow-up is associated prospectively with the risk of incident MetS. Methods. - Using a prospective study design, the development of MetS was examined in 1134 healthy participants from the community. Plasma adiponectin was measured at study entry and again after a median follow-up of 9.4 years (IQR: 9.2-9.7). During follow-up, 187 participants developed MetS, and 439 presented with at least two components of MetS. Results. - During follow-up, adiponectin decreased in participants who developed MetS, whereas adiponectin was increased in those who did not develop MetS (P < 0.001). Those with low adiponectin levels (quartile 1) at baseline had an increased risk of developing MetS (OR: 2.92, 2.08-6.97; P < 0.001) compared with those with high levels (quartile 4). After adjusting for confounding variables, low adiponectin levels at baseline remained independently associated with MetS (OR: 2.24, 1.11-4.52; P = 0.017). Similarly, participants with a decrease in adiponectin during follow-up also had an increased risk of MetS (OR: 2.96, 2.09-4.18; P < 0.001). This association persisted after multivariable adjustments, including for baseline adiponectin (OR: 4.37, 2.77-6.97; P < 0.001). Finally, adiponectin levels at follow-up were inversely associated with an increase in the number of components of MetS (P <0.001); geometric mean adiponectin levels were 9.5 mg/L (95% CI: 9.0-10.0) for participants with no components vs 7.0 mg/L (95% CI: 6.3-7.9) for those with four to five components. Conclusions/interpretation. - Low plasma adiponectin levels at baseline and decreasing adiponectin levels during follow-up are both associated with an increased risk of MetS.

Material and methods: Twenty-five neonates that required ECLS in between November 2010 and November 2015 were evaluated. Results: The median age was 12 days (range 3-28 days) and the median body weight was 3kg (range 2.5-5kg). Venoarterial ECLS was performed in all of the cases. Ascendan aorta-right atrial cannulation in 22 patients and neck cannulation in three patients were performed. The reason for ECLS was E-CPR in two patients, inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in seven patients, respiratory insufficiency and hypoxia in nine patients, low cardiac output (LCOS) in seven patients. Median duration of ECLS was four days (range 1-15). Hemorrhagic complications developed in 15, renal complications in 13, pulmonary complications in 12, infectious complications in 11, neurologic complications in three and mechanical complications in two of the patients. Weaning was successful in 15 of the patients. Eleven patients were successfully discharged. Conclusion: ECLS is an important treatment option that is performed successfully in many centers around the world to maintain life support in patients unresponsive to medical treatment. The utilization of this modality especially in newborns with congenital heart disease should be taken into consideration."

Clinical examination and medical records were collected at the annual health examination. The hazard ratios (HRs) of uric acid for cardio-cerebrovascular events were calculated by Cox proportional hazards models. Generalized additive model and threshold effect analysis were used to explore the non-linear relationship between serum uric acid level and the incidence of cardio-cerebrovascular event. Result: The mean follow-up time was 52 months. When the participants were classified into four groups by the serum acid quarter (Q1-Q4), the HRs (95% CI) of Q2-Q4 for cardio-cerebrovascular events were 1.26 (0.83, 1.92), 1.97 (1.33, 2.91) and 2.05 (1.40, 3.01), respectively, compared with the reference (Q1). The actual incidence and conditional incidence of cardio-cerebrovascular events in the high serum acid group were higher than those in the low serum acid group, which were stratified by the turning point (sUA = 372 mu mol/L). We also showed a strong prognostic accuracy of the multiple variable-based score in 3 years and 5 years, with area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.790 (0.756-0.823) and 0.777 (0.749-0.804), respectively. Conclusion: Serum uric acid level is a strong risk factor for cardio-cerebrovascular events."
1670,Medical , Hepatitis C  , HCV; hemodialysis; hepatopathy; IV iron; ferrotoxicity        ,"About 2.5% of the world population, corresponding to about 177 million individuals, are infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV), a small, single-stranded RNA virus. The prevalence of HCV infection among dialysis patients in Japan, Europe, and North America during the 2012 to 2015 period was found to be 8.7% in the DOPPS study. Nosocomial HCV spread in hemodialysis facilities still occurs. Increased hepatic tissue iron has been shown to play a deleterious role in the course of hepatitis C, favor development of fibrosis and cirrhosis and possibly increase the risk of liver cancer in the general population. Regular loss of blood in the hemodialysis circuit, in routine blood sampling for laboratory tests (for uremia monitoring), and in gut due to uremic enteropathy, invariably results in iron deficiency for which patients are commonly treated with intravenous (IV) iron preparations. Data on the effects of IV iron in hemodialysis patients with hepatitis C are limited (2 studies) and strongly suggest that parenteral iron may contribute to hepatocellular injury. Iatrogenic iron overload is extremely prevalent among hemodialysis population worldwide. Iron overload and toxicity has emerged as one of the most controversial topic in the management of anemia in dialysis patients. Given the known impact of iron in promoting growth and virulence of HCV and the associated liver disease, it is necessary to use iron therapy cautiously and closely monitor plasma markers of iron metabolism and liver iron stores non-invasively by means of MRI to avoid iron overload in this vulnerable population."
1821,Medical , Hepatitis C  , HIV; cancer; non-AIDS-defining cancer; AIDS-defining cancer        ,"Achievement and maintenance of virologic suppression after cancer diagnosis have been associated with improved outcomes in HIV-infected patients, but few studies have analyzed the virologic and immunologic outcomes after a cancer diagnosis. All HIV-infected patients with a diagnosis of cancer between 2000 and 2011 in an urban clinic population in Baltimore, MD, were included for review. HIV-related outcomes (HIV-1 RNA viral load and CD4 cell count) were abstracted and compared for patients with non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) and AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs). Four hundred twelve patients with baseline CD4 or HIV-1 RNA viral load data were analyzed. There were 122 (30%) diagnoses of ADCs and 290 (70%) NADCs. Patients with NADCs had a higher median age (54 years vs. 43 years, p < .0001) and a higher frequency of hepatitis C coinfection (52% vs. 36%, p = .002). The median baseline CD4 was lower for patients with ADCs (137 cells/mm 3 vs. 314 cells/mm 3) and patients with NADCs were more likely to be suppressed at cancer diagnosis (59% vs. 25%) (both p < .0001). The median CD4 for patients with NADCs was significantly higher than patients with ADCs at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis and higher at 18 and 24 months, but not significantly. Patients with an NADC had 2.19 times (95% CI 1.04-4.62) the adjusted odds of being suppressed at 12 months and 2.17 times the odds (95% CI 0.92-5.16) at 24 months compared to patients with an ADC diagnosis. For patients diagnosed with ADCs and NADCs in this urban clinic setting, both virologic suppression and immunologic recovery improved over time. Patients with NADCs had the highest odds of virologic suppression in the 2 years following cancer diagnosis."

These expansions are typically made up of NKG2C(+) NK cells with particular killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) expression patterns. Such NK cell expansion patterns are also seen in patients with viral hepatitis infection. Yet, it is not known if the viral hepatitis infection promotes the appearance of such expansions or if effects are solely attributed to underlying CMV infection. In sizeable cohorts of CMV seropositive hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infected patients, we analyzed NK cells for expression of NKG2A, NKG2C, CD57, and inhibitory KIRs to assess the appearance of NK cell expansions characteristic of what has been seen in CMV seropositive healthy individuals. Adaptive like NK cell expansions observed in viral hepatitis patients were strongly associated with CMV seropositivity. The number of subjects with these expansions did not differ between CMV seropositive viral hepatitis patients and corresponding healthy controls. Hence, we conclude that adaptive-like NK cell expansions observed in HBV, HCV, and/or HDV infected individuals are not caused by the chronic hepatitis infections per se, but rather are a consequence of underlying CMV infection."
2249,Medical , Hepatitis C  , Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Surveillance; Therapy; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; Survival        ,"AIM To assess the impact of underlying liver disease etiology on the presenting features and outcomes in a large cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS A prospective database of all patients with HCC was established from 1998 to March 2012. One thousand and seventy-eight patients were categorized into three groups, based on the etiology of their liver disease: hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and non-viral liver disease (NVLD). Overall survival was determined by Kaplan Meier analysis to time of death or last follow-up. RESULTS HCC patients with HCV (85%) were more likely to be diagnosed as part of a surveillance program, compared to HBV or NVLD (both 71%) (p < 0.001). Patients with NVLD were more likely to receive best supportive care (29%) compared to those with HBV (21%) or HCV (20%) (p < 0.02). Twelve percent of NVLD and 13% of HBV patients underwent liver transplantation compared to 21% of HCV patients (p = 0.001). Median survival from presentation was lowest in NVLD (1.7 years) when compared to HBV (2.8 years) and HCV (2.6 years) (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival included Child Turcotte Pugh score, size of dominant lesion, absence of vascular invasion, and management with surgical resection or liver transplantation. Patient age and the etiology of the underlying liver disease were not independent predictors of survival CONCLUSION Patients with NVLD and HCC were less likely to be enrolled in a HCC surveillance program and are less likely to have curative therapies such as liver resection and transplantation after diagnosis with HCC, when compared to patients with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C."

METHODS Fifty-one cirrhotic patients (17 with portal vein thrombosis) were analyzed. Serum omentin and vaspin levels were measured with commercially available direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). To assess platelet activity, the following tests were performed using a MULTIPLATE (R) PLATELET FUNCTION ANALYZER: (1) an ADP-induced platelet activation test; (2) a cyclooxygenase dependent aggregation test (ASPI test); (3) a von Willebrand factor and glycoprotein Ib-dependent aggregation (using ristocetin) test (RISTO test); and (4) a test for thrombin receptor-activating peptide-6 induced activation of the thrombin receptor, which is sensitive to IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. RESULTS Omentin, but not vaspin, serum concentrations were significantly decreased in patients with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) (P = 0.01). Prothrombin levels were significantly increased in patients with PVT (P = 0.01). The thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) test results were significantly lower in the PVT group (P = 0.03). No significant differences in adipokines serum levels were found regarding the etiology or severity of liver cirrhosis assessed according to the Child-Pugh or Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores. There was a significant increase in the TRAP (P = 0.03), ASPI (P = 0.001) and RISTO high-test (P = 0.02) results in patients with lower MELD scores. Serum omentin and vaspin levels were significantly down-regulated in patients without insulin resistance (P = 0.03, P = 0.02, respectively). A positive relationship between omentin and vaspin levels were found both when all of the patients were analyzed (r = 0.41, P = 0.01) and among those with PVT (r = 0.94, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Serum omentin levels are increased in patients without PVT. Cirrhosis origin and grade do not affect omentin and vaspin levels. The analyzed adipokines do not influence platelet activity."

This study explored various aspects of the disease in the Swedish paediatric population. MethodsA retrospective questionnaire was sent to all 36 Swedish children known to have HAE, and a physician carried out follow-up telephone interviews. ResultsMost of the questionnaires were completed by the parents of 31 (86%) children with HAE, with or without their input, at a median age of nine years (range 1-17), and the physician also interviewed 29. HAE symptoms were experienced by 23 children, including abdominal attacks (96%), skin swelling (78%) and swelling in the mouth and/or upper airways (52%). Psychological stress was the most common trigger for abdominal attacks and trauma and sports triggered skin swelling. The majority (n = 19) had access to complement-1 esterase inhibitor concentrate at home. Current health and quality of life were generally rated as good, independent of whether the child had experienced HAE symptoms or not. ConclusionMost children with HAE had experienced abdominal attacks and skin swelling, but their overall health and quality of life were generally perceived to be good."
2628,Medical , Hereditary Angioedema  , Tissue kallikrein; Plasma kallikrein; Plasmin; Bradykinin B-2 receptor        ,"Aims: The isolated human umbilical vein is a robust contractile bioassay for ligands of the bradykinin (BK) B-2 receptor (B2R), also extendable to B-1 receptor (B1R) pharmacology. We hypothesized that, as a freshly isolated vessel, it also contains traces of plasma proteins that may confer responses to exogenous proteases via the formation of kinins. Main methods: Rings of human umbilical veins were mounted in organ baths containing Krebs buffer maintained at 37 degrees C and purified proteases were introduced in the bathing fluid along with additional drugs/proteins that permit mechanistic analysis of effects. Key findings: The previously described contractile response to human recombinant tissue kallikrein (KLK-1, 1-10 nM) is not influenced by metabolic inhibitors, suggesting its dependence on a preexisting reservoir of low molecular weight-kininogen (LK). Active plasma kallikrein (apK, <= 5 nM) was inactive in fresh tissues, unless high molecular weight-kininogen (HK, 39-197 nM) replenishment was applied. The effects of KLK-1 and HK + apK are abolished by pretreating tissues with icatibant, but not with tranexamic acid. C1-esterase inhibitor inhibited only HK + apK. Purified plasmin and neutrophil proteinase-3 produced small contractions in the presence of HK only, and tissue plasminogen activator, none. B1R stimulation was pharmacologically evidenced in response to KLK-1 if LK was supplied. Significance: The pharmacology of KLK-1 and HK + apK in the human isolated umbilical vein is essentially based on the activity of locally generated kinins and this assaymodels the inhibitory action of some therapeutic agents active in angioedema states. Proteases that indirectly generate kinins have little activity in the system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The origin of this clinical presentation can be either genetic or acquired. The outcome within the patient is subcutaneous swelling of the lower layers of the epidermis. Symptoms are most often localized to the upper airway or the gastrointestinal tract. A typical course resolves in 5 to 7 days, but in some patients, the clinical manifestations exist up to 6 weeks. Hereditary AE is rare and genetically linked, and typically, the patient has episodes for many years before diagnosis. Episodes of acquired AE may be drug induced, triggered by a specific allergen, or idiopathic. Angioedema can elicit the need for critical care interventions, for advanced airway management, or unnecessary abdominal surgery. The treatment for these patients is evolving as new pharmacological agents are developed. This article addresses subtypes of AE, triggers, pharmacology, and information for interdisciplinary team planning of individualized case management."

They may either co-occur or present as independent conditions. They are characterized by a complex pathomechanism, and their symptoms may be triggered by diverse factors. These differences are crucial for developing a successful treatment regimen. Both conditions may have an allergic origin (immunoglobulin [Ig] E and non-IgE-related), usually induced by histamine, or a nonallergic one, such as bradykinin-mediated angioedema in patients with C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency or angioedema induced by certain drugs (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Currently, we distinguish 5 types of nonallergic angioedema: hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1-INH deficiency, acquired angioedema (AAE), and angioedema induced by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, all of which are mediated by bradykinin, as well as pseudoallergic angioedema and idiopathic angioedema. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema (eg, laryngeal angioedema) may be life-threatening because of resistance to corticosteroids and antihistamine drugs. C1-INH concentrates are the drugs of choice in the treatment of HAE and AAE. In recent years, some new drugs have been introduced in the treatment of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, such as bradykinin B-2-receptor antagonist, icatibant, and kallikrein inhibitor, ecallantide, which allow to improve treatment outcomes."

It is vital that anaesthesiologists understand this condition, as it may present suddenly in the perioperative period with airway compromise. To identify literature for this review, the authors searched the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases for English language articles covering a 10-year period, 2006 through 2016. Angioedema can be either mast-cell mediated or bradykinin-induced. Older therapies for histaminergic symptoms are well known to anaesthesiologists (e.g., adrenaline, anti-histamines and steroids), whereas older therapies for bradykinin-induced symptoms include plasma and attenuated androgens. New classes of drugs for bradykinin-induced symptoms are now available, including anti-bradykinin, plasma kallikrein inhibitor and C1 esterase inhibitors. These can be used prophylactically or as rescue medications. Anaesthesiologists are in a unique position to coordinate perioperative care for this complex group of patients."

These factors include the patient's socio-economic background, age, gender, presenting symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings and, in particular, non-adherence versus adherence to therapy. Methods Data were collected from all adult patients admitted to Kalafong Hospital with laboratory confirmed cryptococcal meningitis over a period of 24 months. We analyzed the data by the presentation of descriptive summary statistics, logistic regression was used to assess factors which showed association between outcome of measure and factor. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis using all the factors that showed significant association in the cross tabulation was applied to determine which factors had an impact on the patients' mortality risk. Results A total of 87 patients were identified. All except one were HIV-positive, of which 55.2% were antiretroviral therapy naive. A history of previous tuberculosis was given by 25 patients (28.7%) and 49 (56.3%) were on tuberculosis treatment at admission or started during their hospital stay. In-hospital mortality was 31%. Statistical analysis showed that antiretroviral therapy naive patients had 9.9 (CI 95% 1.2-81.2, p<0.0032) times greater odds of dying compared to those on antiretroviral therapy, with 17 from 48 patients (35.4%) dying compared with 1 out of 21 patients (4.8%) on treatment. Defaulters had 14.7 (CI 95% 1.6-131.6, p<0.016) times greater odds of dying, with 9 from 18 patients dying (50%), compared to the non-defaulters. In addition, patients who presented with nausea and vomiting had a 6.3 (95% CI 1.7-23.1, p<0.005) times greater odds of dying (18/47, 38.3%); this remained significant when adjusted for antiretroviral therapy naive patients and defaulters. Conclusion Cryptococcal meningitis is still a common opportunistic infection in people living with HIV/AIDS resulting in hospitalization and a high mortality. Defaulting antiretroviral therapy and presentation with nausea and vomiting were associated with a significantly increased mortality risk."

Our study was conducted to further investigate the model of social support and care for People Living with HIV/AIDS(PLHA), to explore their role in People Living with AIDS's quality of life (QOL) as reference for improving nursing policies for AIDS. Background. Social support and care are the most important factors impacting the QOL of People Living with HIV/AIDS, but most studies conducted upon the influence of social support and QOL of People Living with HIV/AIDS are mainly based on cross-sectional design. Design. Our study was a nonrandomised controlled community intervention study. Methods. The participants diagnosed as People Living with HIV/AIDS at Beijing You An Hospital received a comprehensive social support care from December 2013 to December 2014. To evaluate the impact of social support and care model on People Living with HIV/AIDS, our study analysed the different dimension scores of social support scale and quality of life before and after the intervention. Correlation between the net benefit value of social support and that of QOL from various dimensions were analysed. Results. There were significant differences in the score of objective support and usage of support (all p = 0.02) for social support. Net values of objective support score and usage of support were 0.25 and 0.19, respectively, after intervention. There were significant differences in physiological function, role physical, general health, vitality, social function, mental health, health transition and total score of quality of life (all p < 0.05). The canonical correlation analysis of net values of social support and QOL indicated that the first and second canonical correlation were statistically significant, with correlation coefficients of 0.53 (p = 0.00) and 0.21 (p = 0.04). Conclusion. Social support and care intervention model can effectively improve perceived subjective feeling on social support and QOL condition for People Living with HIV/AIDS. And strategies to improve social support and care intervention programmes are strongly encouraged. Relevance to clinical practice. The method is simple and cost-effective and could be a way to improve the quality of life condition for People Living with HIV/AIDS."

Food insecurity has been identified as a potential risk factor for poor virologic response, but the association between these factors has been inconsistently documented in the literature. We systematically searched five electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant studies through April 2015 and retrieved 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria, of which nine studies were conducted in North America and the remaining two studies were in Brazil and Uganda respectively. Meta-analyzed results indicated that experiencing food insecurity resulted in 29% lower odds of achieving complete HIV viral suppression (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.82) and this significant inverse association was consistently found regardless of study design, exposure measurement, and confounder adjustment methods. These findings suggest that food insecurity is a potential risk factor for incomplete HIV viral suppression in people living with HIV."

Variations in oxidative stress and antioxidant levels are related to the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our study aimed to investigate the possible correlation between ATM and TH levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and FT4/FT3. We measured serum concentrations of TSH, FT4, and FT3 in 205 individuals, including 42 ATM patients, 49 multiple sclerosis patients, and 114 healthy controls. Our findings show that ATM patients had lower levels of TSH and FT3 and higher levels of FT4 and FT4/FT3 compared with healthy controls, whether male or female. Moreover, levels of TSH and FT3 in patients with ATM were inversely correlated with disease severity measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale. Variations in TH level may represent the oxidative status and are surrogate biomarkers of the incidence and severity of ATM. NeuroReport 28: 292-297 Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The aims of this study were to evaluate these risks in such patients, to determine the risk factors and finally to set some recommendations. Methods It is a cross-sectional study about 180 patients with known and treated adrenal insufficiency. The patients responded to a 14-item questionnaire concerning their knowledge about the disease and fasting during the last month of Ramadan. Results There were 132 women and 48 men. The mean age was 47.6 +/- 15.0 years (14-79). One hundred and thirty eight patients (76.7 %) were advised by their physician not to fast. Ninety-one patients (50.5 %) tried to fast. Complications occurred in 61 cases (67.0 %): asthenia in 88.5% of cases, intense thirst in 32.8 %, symptoms of dehydration in 49.2% and symptoms of hypoglycaemia in 18 %. One patient was hospitalized. Fifty-five patients (60.4 %) were able to fast for the whole month. Age, gender, duration of the disease, its primary origin, associated hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or diabetes insipidus and daily dose of hydrocortisone did not significantly differ between fasters and non-fasters, full-month-fasters and partial-month-fasters, and fasters with complications and fasters without complications. The frequency of adequate knowledge about the disease was significantly higher in full-month-fasters vs. partial-month-fasters, and in fasters without complications vs. those with complications. Conclusion In patients with adrenal insufficiency, fasting can cause complications especially if the level of knowledge about the disease is low."

METHODS VSG is being performed more frequently worldwide as a treatment for medically-complicated obesity, and dysphagia is common post-operatively. We hypothesize that post-operative dysphagia is related to underlying medical conditions or narrowing of the gastric sleeve. This is a retrospective, single institution study of consecutive patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy from 2013 to 2015. Patients with previous bariatric procedures were excluded. Narrowing of a gastric sleeve includes: inability to pass a 9.6 mm gastroscope due to stenosis or sharp angulation or spiral hindering its passage. RESULTS Of 400 consecutive patients, 352 are included; the prevalence of dysphagia is 22.7%; 33 patients (9.3%) have narrowing of the sleeve with 25 (7.1%) having sharp angulation or a spiral while 8 (2.3%) have a stenosis. All 33 patients underwent balloon dilatation of the gastric sleeve and dysphagia resolved in 13 patients (39%); 10 patients (30%) noted resolution of dysphagia after two additional dilatations. In a multivariate model, medical conditions associated with post-operative dysphagia include diabetes mellitus, symptoms of esophageal reflux, a low whole blood thiamine level, hypothyroidism, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and use of opioids. CONCLUSION Narrowing of the gastric sleeve and gastric sleeve stenosis are common after VSG. Endoscopic balloon dilatations of the gastric sleeve resolves dysphagia in 69% of patients."

However, whether or when PH is a maladaptive versus adaptive phenomenon remains to be determined. Despite their differing prognoses, it does appear that the IIPs may follow a similar course once PH supervenes. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to explore studies of PH medications in IIP as a group rather than as individual entities. Such a broad approach eliminates the need to nuance specific diagnoses and thereby facilitates study recruitment and broadens the applicability of the results. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

To test OGG1-BER was mimicked by repeatedly exposing diploid lung fibroblasts cells and airways of mice to 8-oxoG base. Results showed that repeated exposures led to G1 cell cycle arrest and pre-matured senescence of cultured cells in which over 1000 genes were differentially expressed 86% of them been identical to those in naturally senesced cells. Gene ontology analysis of gene expression displayed biological processes driven by small GTPases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen activated kinase cascades both in cultured cells and lungs. These results together, points to a new paradigm about the role of DNA damage and repair by OGG1 in aging and age-associated disease processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

Aging contributes to common processes including metabolic dysfunction, DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species generation. Although glycolysis has been linked to cell growth and proliferation, the mechanisms by which the activation of glycolysis by aging regulates fibrogenesis in the lung remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine if glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-induced glycolysis regulates age-dependent fibrogenesis of the lung. Mouse and human lung tissues were analyzed for GLUT1 and glycolytic markers using immunoblotting. Glycolytic function was measured using a Seahorse apparatus. To study the effect of GLUT1, genetic inhibition of GLUT1 was performed by short hairpin RNA transduction, and phloretin was used for pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1. GLUT1-dependent glycolysis is activated in aged lung. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1 suppressed the protein expression of a-smooth muscle actin, a key cytoskeletal component of activated fibroblasts, in mouse primary lung fibroblast cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the activation of AMP activated protein kinase, which is regulated by GLUT1-dependent glycolysis, represents a critical metabolic pathway for fibroblast activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phloretin, a potent inhibitor of GLUT1, significantly inhibited bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo. These results suggest that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis regulates fibrogenesis in aged lung and that inhibition of GLUT1 provides a potential target of therapy of age-related lung fibrosis."

Viral infections may be associated with IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases. In the present study, we investigate for the first time in Iran the related viral etiology of IPF in order to detect three respiratory viruses; human adenovirus, enterovirus and bocavirus. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study which was supported by Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. The diagnostic criteria for IPF were based on internationally accepted clinical and imaging criteria in accordance with the 2011 IPF guidelines. 30 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs or broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained from the lung of IPF patients that were diagnosed by a sophisticated practitioner from April 2015 to February 2016. Real-time (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was performed to detect the three viruses. Fluorescence dye of a labeled probe recorded the results in order to create positive and negative controls. SPSS version 20 software was used to calculate basic descriptive and frequency features. Results: Of 30 specimens, 13 (43.4%) were male and 17 (56.6%) were female with the total mean age standard deviation 68.2 +/- 12.0. RT-PCR assay results illustrated there was no infection of human adenovirus, enterovirus, and bocavirus detected in these samples. Significant results between IPF incidence and variables were not significant (p >0.05). Conclusion: The causes of IPF in Iranian patients need more research although, based on the results of this study, there was no association between human adenovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus, and IPF. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods and results: We retrospectively analysed the clinical, radiological and pathological features of 26 patients with CPFE, 11 with IPF, and 23 with emphysema. We evaluated pulmonary vascular, venous-venular and arteriolar tissue changes in the fibrotic, emphysematous and relatively unaffected (preserved) areas by using the Heath-Edwards scoring system. We found moderate-to-severe vasculopathy in the CPFE group, but no significant differences in the fibrotic and emphysematous areas among the three groups. However, in the preserved area, the grading was significantly different among the three groups (P < 0.001), and vasculopathy in the CPFE group was the most severe. Although venous-venular and arteriolar changes in almost all fibrotic and emphysematous areas in the three groups showed no significant differences, there were significant differences in venous-venular (P = 0.004) and arteriolar (P < 0.001) changes in the preserved area among the three groups, which were most prevalent in the CPFE group. In the CPFE group, venous-venular changes and vasculopathy by Heath-Edwards grading were highest in the fibrotic area and lowest in the preserved area. Conclusions: These results imply that pulmonary vasculopathy in patients with CPFE could occur in the whole lung tissue. This may explain the tendency for it to lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension in CPFE cases."

To study colon morphology and motor function in female patients with medically refractory chronic constipation with or without uro-gynecological symptoms and to assess clinical outcomes following laparoscopic ileo-proctostomy. Colon anatomy and cecal emptying time were assessed with plain films and fluoroscopy following a standardized test meal mixed with barium. Transit time was determined with radiopaque markers. IBS-QOL and urinary incontinence questionnaires were employed to assess post-colectomy clinical response. In 21 consecutive patients, mean colon transit time (h) was 211.1 +/- 11.3, which was significantly greater than 58.9 +/- 5.1 of 10 normal subjects (P < 0.001). Mega-cecum was found in 15 (Group 1) with mean cecal volume of 587 +/- 27.9 cm(3), significantly greater (P < 0.001) than 169.5 +/- 10.4 cm(3) of six without mega-cecum (Group 2). Mean cecal empting time (days) of barium-mixed feces in Group 1, 4.0 +/- 0.6 was significantly greater than 1.33 +/- 0.21 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). Eighteen patients (Groups 1 and 2) who had laparoscopic ileo-proctostomy experienced significantly improved quality of life (P < 0.001). In particular, Group 1 patients benefited significantly from improved uro-gynecological symptoms. Hitherto an unrecognized mega-cecum with markedly impaired emptying function was found in patients with severe slow transit constipation and uro-gynecological symptoms. Subtotal colectomy relieved constipation and improved significantly uro-gynecological symptoms, suggesting strongly that mega-cecum is causally related to these symptoms."

Reports of cessation of symptom and signs of both major types of IBS have been published using a non-systemic, topically active agent-high potency polymerized cross-linked sucralfate (HPPCLS). The unique clinical effect of this non-systemic agent restricted to the luminal surface of the gut provides opportunity to elaborate on an alternative working model for the pathogenesis of IBS and FGIDs. While the chemical determinants of HPPCLS and the mucosal lining contribute to the clinical effects, the sequence of events resides in the functional interplay among elements within the mucosa itself. The proposed model assumes that failure of a pre-existing genomic-controlled surveillance of the epithelium localized to the luminal surface triggers primary and secondary immune activation of inflammation intent on restoring epithelial homeostasis. Delayed restoration of homeostasis results in all the symptoms, signs and likely molecular events that characterize IBS and FGIDs."

The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the medium-term efficacy of SNS for IBS to establish whether SNS could have a future role in the treatment of IBS. Method Patients with IBS who had previously been implanted with a permanent neurostimulator as part of a randomized, controlled, crossover study, were assessed for medium-term follow-up. The primary end-point was change in the IBS-specific symptom score (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Irritable Bowel Syndrome version questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. The secondary end-point was a change in the IBS-specific quality of life score (Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Impact Scale questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. Results Of 26 patients, 20 were eligible for 3-year follow- up. The median IBS-specific symptom score was significantly lower at 3-year follow-up (30, range 1371) than at baseline (62, 45-80) (P = 0.0001). The effect was observed in all symptom clusters within the score. Also, the median IBS-specific quality of life score was significantly improved at 3-year follow-up (52, 26-169) compared with baseline (135, 82-180, P = 0.0002). The effect was observed in all domains of the score. As per the protocol, 75% of patients were judged therapeutic successes. Seventy per cent of patients had a more than 50% reduction in daily IBS symptoms.

METHODS An individual patient data meta-analysis was per-formed on two randomized clinical trials studying the effect of S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 supplementation on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in IBS subjects. A total of 579 IBS subjects were included. Outcomes were the daily Likert scale scores of abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating [area under the curve (AUC) and weekly means], responder status, and bowel movements (stool frequency and consistency). Statistical analyses were conducted in Intent to Treat (ITT) population, IBS-C subjects and IBS-C subjects with an abdominal pain/ discomfort score higher than or equal to 2 at baseline ("" IBS-C (>=) 2 subpopulation""). RESULTS S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 significantly improved abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating during the second month of supplementation [AUC (W5-W8)] with improvement up to the minimal clinically relevant threshold of 10%: a 12.3% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort in the ITT population compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.0134) has been observed. In the IBS-C >= 2 subpopulation, there were a 13.1% reduction of abdominal pain/discomfort and a 14.9% reduction of bloating compared to the Placebo group (P = 0.0194 and P = 0.0145, respectively). GI symptoms significantly decreased during supplementation but no statistical differences were reported between groups at the end of the supplementation period. Responder status was defined as a subject who experienced a decrease of 1 arbitrary unit (a.u.) or 50% of the abdominal discomfort score from baseline for at least 2 wk out of the last 4 wk of the study. A significant difference between groups was reported in the ITT population, when considering the first definition: subjects in the Active group had 1.510 higher odds to be a responder (reduction of 1 a.u. of abdominal pain/discomfort) compared with subjects in the Placebo group (P = 0.0240). At the end of supplementation period, stool consistency in the Active group of the ITT population was significantly improved and classified as ""normal"" compared to Placebo (respectively 3.13 +/- 1.197 a.u. vs 2.58 +/- 1.020 a.u., P = 0.0003). Similar results were seen in the IBS-C = 2 subpopulation (Active group: 3.14 +/- 1.219 a.u. vs Placebo group: 2.59 +/- 1.017 a.u., P = 0.0009).

The standards designed by institutions and/or professional societies, such as Royal Colleges and Medical Councils in high-income nations with well-developed health systems and infrastructures, are often not easily translatable to issues critical to nephrology practice in low-income nations. Little or no guidance is provided on common nephrological issues of regional nature or pertaining to ethnic minorities and disadvantaged groups living in those countries. There is an emergent need for a training curriculum that meets the needs and peculiarities of the developing nations, and this needs to leverage on the existing and well-validated systems of training across the globe. We evaluated nephrology training programs across 25 upper-middle and high-income nations to identify best practices and opportunities for adoption in low-income nations. We reviewed training guidelines from major professional societies on content and process of training. There are similarities and differences in structure, content, and process of training programs across countries, and there are clearly adoptable concepts/frameworks for application in low-income nations. We provide recommendations and a strategic plan for the future focus of nephrology training in the developing world to align with current trends in technological advancement and development as well as the need for emphasis on prevention of CKD.

Renal aging is a multifactorial process where gender, race and genetic background and several key-mediators such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, the renin angiotensin aldosterone (RAAS) system, impairment in kidney repair capacities and background cardiovascular disease play a significant role. Features of the aging kidney include macroscopic and microscopic changes and important functional adaptations, none of which is pathognomonic of aging. The assessment of renal function in the framework of aging is problematic and the question whether renal aging should be considered as a physiological or pathological process remains a much debated issue. Although promising dietary and pharmacological approaches have been tested to retard aging processes or renal function decline in the elderly, proper lifestyle modifications, as those applicable to the general population, currently represent the most plausible approach to maintain kidney health.

Objective This article outlines the clinical significance of CKD in the elderly and summarises recently updated recommendations for its assessment, staging and management. Discussion Most elderly patients with CKD present asymptomatically. Despite this, it is clinically significant as it is one of the most potent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Even modest reductions in eGFR are associated with an increased prevalence of CKD-related complications such as anaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Early detection is an important strategy and should include all three components of the kidney health check (blood pressure measurement, a blood test for serum creatinine and eGFR, and a urine test for albumin:creatinine ratio). Treatment is guided by the patient's stage of CKD, based on kidney function (eGFR) and kidney damage (degree of albuminuria), and control of blood pressure to recommended levels with appropriate medications. The majority of elderly patients with CKD will not ultimately require, or desire, renal replacement therapy and may be safely managed in general practice."

Human obesity is a risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. Objectives To investigate the possible association of weight loss on plasma and renal biomarkers of kidney health. Animals Thirty-seven obese dogs that lost weight were included in the study. Methods Prospective observational study. Three novel biomarkers of renal functional impairment, disease, or both (homocysteine, cystatin C, and clusterin), in addition to traditional markers of chronic renal failure (serum urea and creatinine, urine specific gravity [USG], urine protein-creatinine ratio [UPCR], and urine albumin corrected by creatinine [UAC]) before and after weight loss in dogs with naturally occurring obesity were investigated. Results Urea (P=.043) and USG (P=.012) were both greater after weight loss than before loss, whilst UPCR, UAC, and creatinine were less after weight loss (P=.032, P=.006, and P=.026, respectively). Homocysteine (P<.001), cystatin C (P<.001) and clusterin (P<.001) all decreased upon weight loss. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed associations between percentage weight loss (greater weight loss, more lean tissue loss; r=-0.67, r2=0.45, P<.001) and before-loss plasma clusterin concentration (greater clusterin, more lean tissue loss; r=0.48, r2=0.23, P=.003). Conclusion and Clinical Importance These results suggest possible subclinical alterations in renal function in canine obesity, which improve with weight loss. Further work is required to determine the nature of these alterations and, most notably, the reason for the association between before loss plasma clusterin and subsequent lean tissue loss during weight management."

The use of biopsies to determine kidney health after kidney transplantation is an invasive procedure with some risk to the patient. Consequently, a noninvasive test for transplanted kidney health would provide a significant advantage over current clinical practice. Methods. Urines from kidney donors before nephrectomy, pretransplant patients with native kidney disease, and posttransplant kidney recipients were examined for protein biomarkers to diagnose or prognose kidney disease. Proteins were extracted by C4 reverse phase affinity and analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results. Urine from individuals with healthy kidneys showed few components other than two ubiquitous saposin B glycoisoforms. Patients with kidney disease lacked saposin B and showed new components in two patterns: the most common contained beta-2 microglobulin (B2M, m/z = 11,732) plus one or more peaks at m/z = 10,350, 9480, 4337, and 4180. Pattern 2 lacked beta-2 microglobulin but contained several degradation products of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Other pathologic components included urinary protein 1 (m/z = 15,835), transthyretin (m/z= 13,880), and a component at m/z = 13,350. Conclusions. Patients with acute rejection showed profiles that ranged from those of kidney donors to those of advanced kidney disease. The range of patterns may be useful for analysis of transplant patients without complications and persons with developing kidney disease before or after transplant."

1347,Medical , Low Testosterone  , Metabolic syndrome; Testosterone; Type2 diabetes        ,"A significant proportion of patients with type2 diabetes mellitus have a low testosterone level relative to reference ranges based on healthy young men. Only a small number of these patients suffer from classical hypogonadism as a result of recognizable hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology. The cut-off value of the serum testosterone level in men without obvious hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis pathology is controversial. It is unclear to what extent a low serum testosterone level causally leads to type2 diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome. From a theoretical standpoint, there can be complex interactions among the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, body composition and insulin resistance, which can be further influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic factors to give rise to metabolic syndrome, glucose intolerance, and low-grade inflammation to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although a low serum testosterone level frequently coexists with cardiometabolic risk factors and might serve as a biomarker, more studies are required to clarify the causal, mediating or modifying roles of low serum testosterone level in the development of adverse clinical outcomes. Currently, there are insufficient randomized clinical trial data to evaluate the effects of testosterone replacement therapy on meaningful clinical outcomes. The risk-to-benefit ratio of testosterone therapy in high-risk subjects, such as those with type2 diabetes, also requires elucidation. The present article aims to review the current evidence on low serum testosterone levels in patients with type2 diabetes, and its implications on cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic syndrome and adverse clinical outcomes."

Low vitamin D is frequent in this condition and seems to be more important than testosterone in inducing low bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. Supplementation with vitamin D restores BMD after 2 years of treatment, whereas testosterone alone seems to be ineffective. Introduction Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is frequent, and it has been traditionally related to low testosterone (T) levels. However, low BMD can be observed also in patients with normal T levels and T replacement therapy does not necessarily increase bone mass in these patients. Nothing is known about vitamin D levels and supplementation in KS. In this study, we determine vitamin D status and bone mass in KS subjects and compare the efficacy of T therapy and vitamin D supplementation on BMD. Methods A total of 127 non-mosaic KS patients and 60 age-matched male controls were evaluated with reproductive hormones, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, PTH, and bone densitometry by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Patients with hypogonadism and/or 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency were treated with T-gel 2 % and/or calcifediol and re-evaluated after 24 months of treatment. Results 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower in KS patients with respect to controls, and they had significantly lower lumbar and femoral BMD. The percentage of osteopenia/osteoporosis in subjects with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was higher with respect to subjects with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D and was not related to the presence/absence of low T levels. Subjects treated with calcifediol or T + calcifediol had a significant increase in lumbar BMD after treatment. No difference was found in T-treated group. Conclusion These data highlight that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels seem to have a more critical role than low T levels in inducing low BMD in KS subjects. Furthermore, vitamin D supplementation seems to be more effective than T replacement therapy alone in increasing BMD."
1607,Medical , Low Testosterone  , testosterone; diabetes; glucose metabolism; insulin resistance; obesity        ,"A wealth of observational studies show that low testosterone is associated with insulin resistance and with an increased risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Experimental studies have identified potential mechanisms by which low testosterone may lead to insulin resistance. Visceral adipose tissue is an important intermediate in this relationship. Actions of testosterone or its metabolite oestradiol on other tissues such as muscle, liver, bone or the brain, and body composition-independent effects may also play a role. However, definitive evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether the association of low testosterone with disordered glucose metabolism is causative is currently lacking. It therefore remains possible that this association is due to reverse causation, or simply originates by association with common health and lifestyle factors. RCTs of testosterone therapy in men with or without diabetes consistently show modest metabolically favourable changes in body composition. Despite this, testosterone effects on glucose metabolism have been inconsistent. Recent evidence suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis suppression in the majority of obese men with metabolic disorders is functional, and may be, at least in part, reversible with weight loss. Until further evidence is available, lifestyle measures with emphasis on weight reduction, treatment of comorbidities and optimisation of diabetic control should remain the first-line treatment in these men. Such measures, if successful, may be sufficient to normalise testosterone levels in men with metabolic disorders, who typically have only modest reductions in circulating testosterone levels."

The exact pathophysiology of the negative effects of varicocele on testicular function is not well understood, but theories include venous stasis, increased testicular temperature, oxidative stress, and resulting toxic environment. While prior studies report conflicting effects of nonmicrosurgical varicocelectomy on testosterone level, recent literature demonstrates that microsurgical varicocelectomy improves testosterone levels in men with varicocele and low testosterone preoperatively."

The CSCs play an important role in the tumor initiation, development, relapse, metastasis, and the ineffectiveness of conventional cancer therapies. CD47 is a ligand for signal-regulatory protein-alpha expressed on phagocytic cells and functions to inhibit phagocytosis. This study was to explore if the expression of CD47 is the mechanism used by lung cancer cells, especially CSCs, to escape phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo. Here, we selected CD133 as the marker for lung CSCs according to previous reports. We analyzed lung cancer and matched adjacent normal (non-tumor) tissue and revealed that CD47 is overexpressed on lung cancer cells, especially on lung CSCs. The mRNA expression levels of CD47 and CD133 correlated with a decreased probability of survival for multiple types of lung cancer. Blocking CD47 function with anti-CD47 antibodies enabled macrophage phagocytosis of lung cancer cells and lung CSCs. Anti-CD47 antibodies inhibited tumor growth in immunodeficient mouse xenotransplantation models established with lung cancer cells or lung CSCs and improved survival in tumor-bearing animals. These data indicate that CD47 is a valid target for cancer therapies, especially for anti-CSC therapies."

Whole-exome sequencing revealed a pathogenic PIK3CD variant in a patient with history of immunologic impairment, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and lymphoid hyperplasia presenting as intussusception.

However, such mutations occur in a minority of patients. To investigate the clinical application of targeting JAK for ALK-ALCL, we treated ALK-cell lines of various histological origins with JAK inhibitors. Interestingly, most exogenous cytokine-independent cell lines responded to JAK inhibition regardless of JAK mutation status. JAK inhibitor sensitivity correlated with the STAT3 phosphorylation status of tumor cells. Using retroviral shRNA knockdown, we have demonstrated that these JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells are dependent on both JAK1 and STAT3 for survival. JAK1 and STAT3 gain-of-function mutations were found in some, but not all, JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells. Moreover, the mutations alone cannot explain the JAK1/STAT3 dependency, given that wildtype JAK1 or STAT3 was sufficient to promote cell survival in the cells that had either JAK1or STAT3 mutations. To investigate whether other mechanisms were involved, we knocked down upstream receptors GP130 or IL-2R gamma. Knockdown of GP130 or IL-2R. induced cell death in selected JAK inhibitor-sensitive cells. High expression levels of cytokines, including IL-6, were demonstrated in cell lines as well as in primary ALK-ALCL tumors. Finally, ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, was effective in vivo in a xenograft ALK-ALCL model. Our data suggest that cytokine receptor signaling is required for tumor cell survival in diverse forms of ALK-ALCL, even in the presence of JAK1/STAT3 mutations. Therefore, JAK inhibitor therapy might benefit patients with ALK-ALCL who are phosphorylated STAT3(+)."

Although this age old axiom is vastly accurate, thorough study over the last 15 years has given us unprecedented information on the involvement of epigenetic in cancer. Various biochemical pathways that are essential towards tumorigenesis are regulated by the epigenetic phenomenons like remodeling of nucleosome by histone modifications, DNA methylation and miRNA mediated targeting of various genes. Moreover the presence of mutations in the genes controlling the epigenetic players has further strengthened the association of epigenetics in cancer. This merger has opened up newer avenues for targeted anti-cancer drug therapy with numerous pharmaceutical industries focusing on expanding their research and development pipeline with epigenetic drugs. The information provided here elaborates the elementary phenomena of the various epigenetic regulators and discusses their alteration associated with the development of cancer. We also highlight the recent developments in epigenetic drugs combining preclinical and clinical data to signify this evolving field in cancer research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
2655,Medical , Medicare  , Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension; Parkinson's disease; falls; healthcare costs; cost of falls        ,"Aims: To compare patient characteristics, rates, and costs of medically attended falls among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and probable PD plus neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (PD+nOH). Materials and methods: MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases (January 1, 2009-December 31, 2013) were used to identify PD and probable PD+nOH patients. The first medical or prescription claim suggesting these diagnoses served as the index date. Baseline characteristics and post-index all-cause and fall-related healthcare utilization and costs were compared between patient groups. Results: A total of 17,421 PD and 281 PD+nOH patients were identified. Compared with PD patients, PD+nOH patients were older (77 vs 74 years; p<.0001) and had more comorbidities. Pre- and post-index date, more PD+nOH patients had a medically attended fall than PD patients (25% vs 20% [p=.0159] and 30% vs 21% [p=0.0002], respectively). Fallers in both groups had similar numbers of medically attended falls 12-months pre-index (mean =1.9), but PD+nOH fallers had more falls post-index (2.5 vs 2.0; p=.0176). Compared with PD patients, more PD+nOH patients (all p<.01) had fall-related emergency department (ED) visits (18% vs 10%), hospitalizations (7% vs 3%), and non-office visit outpatient services (15% vs 10%). Adjusted total post-index medical costs for falls ($2,260 vs $1,049; p=.0002) and total all-cause costs ($31,260 vs $20,910; p<.0001) were higher for PD+nOH vs PD patients. Limitations: This study had some limitations. There is no ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for nOH, so a combination of PD and OH diagnoses (with confounding conditions excluded) served as a proxy for an nOH diagnosis. Also, the rate of falls and associated costs in these cohorts might be under-reported because only medically attended falls were evaluated. Conclusions: PD+nOH patients had a higher prevalence of pre-existing comorbidities and a higher rate of medically attended falls than those with PD alone, leading to increased costs of care."

Methods: We identified postmenopausal women in a population-based cohort commencing endocrine therapy for invasive primary breast cancer between December 2005 and December 2008 (n = 645). Individual-level administrative health records and self-report data were used to determine women's demographic and clinical characteristics, including preexisting and newly-treated comorbidities, and switches in endocrine therapy. Time to therapy switching was calculated. Chi-square tests compared the characteristics of women who did and did not switch, and those switching within 2 years or after 2 years of commencing therapy. Results: Twenty-eight percent of women switched from their initial endocrine therapy, most commonly from tamoxifen to anastrozole, or the converse. A small number of anastrozole-to-exemestane and letrozole-to-exemestane switches were observed (n = 19). Most women (>80%) who switched therapies did not have newly-treated comorbidities. Few women (<5%) switched before completing 2 years of therapy, but these women were significantly more likely to have preexisting antidepressant use than women switching later (43% vs 23%, P = 0.048) and remained on the subsequent therapy for less time (6 months vs 2.7 years, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Approximately one-quarter of postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer switched endocrine therapies. The findings suggest that the majority of switching in Australian practice was planned; occurring after 2-3 years of, not precipitated by comorbidity, and in a sequence supported by trial evidence. Early switching, however, was associated with preexisting depression and appeared to be a marker of poor persistence."

MethodsSurgical volume for procedures performed primarily by FPMRS surgeons at eight academic institutions across the US was collected using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for stress urinary incontinence repair and revision surgeries from 2007 to 2013. SAS statistical software was used to assess for trends in the data. ResultsThere was a decrease in the use of synthetic mesh sling for the treatment of SUI at academic tertiary care centers over the past 7 years; however, this was not statistically significant. While the total number of surgical interventions for SUI remained stable, there was an increase in the utilization of autologous fascia pubovaginal slings (AFPVS). The number of mesh sling revision surgeries, including urethrolysis and removal or revision of slings, increased almost three-fold at these centers. ConclusionsThese observed trends suggest a possible effect of the FDA Public Health Notifications regarding TVM on surgical practice for SUI in academic centers, even though they did not specifically warn against the use of synthetic mesh for this indication. Indications for surgery, complications, and outcomes were not evaluated during this retrospective study. However, such data may provide alternative insights into reasons for the observed trends.

Extensive experimental data and epidemiological studies have shown that the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and atherosclerosis caused by air pollution are mainly due to the PM component. Implicated in these adverse health effects of PM, is their ability to induce oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory events in the vascular system. The association between the cardiovascular ischemic events and atherosclerosis induced by PM has been linked to the ultrafine and fine components. These particles have a high content of redox cyclic chemicals. This, together with their ability to combine with proatherogenic molecules enhanced tissue oxidative stress. Studies have shown that the oxidative stress induced by PM could up-regulates the expression of phase I and phase II metabolize enzymes. This up-regulation occurs by the activation of transcription factors (such as nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2-related factor (Nrf2) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)). This review will focus on data supporting the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in PM-induced cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis and the importance of Nrf2-and AhR- dependent regulatory pathways in the PM-induced cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis.

3350,Medical , Medicare  , Anemia; infections; safety issues        ,"Among end-stage renal disease patients maintained by hemodialysis, anemia has been managed primarily through erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and intravenous (IV) iron. Following concerns about the cardiovascular (CV) safety of ESAs and changes in the reimbursement policies in Medicare's ESRD program, the use of IV iron has increased. IV iron supplementation promotes hemoglobin production and reduces ESA requirements, yet there exists relatively little evidence on the long-term safety of iron supplementation in hemodialysis patients. Labile iron can induce oxidative stress and is also essential in bacterial growth, leading to concerns about IV iron use and risk of CV events and infections in hemodialysis patients. Existing randomized controlled trials provide little evidence about safety due to insufficient power and short follow-up; recent observational studies have been inconsistent, but some have associated iron exposure with increased risk of infections and CV events. Given the widespread use and potential safety concerns related to IV iron, well-designed large prospective studies are needed to assess to identify optimal strategies for iron administration that maximize its benefits while avoiding potential risks."

Although basic mechanisms of its origin and development are known, some important steps in this process are still waiting for more detailed explanation. Therefore, in addition to already proved aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol, appropriate timing of atherosclerosis treatment is of the essence. Revealing different stages of atherosclerotic process, less or more sensitive to treatment is of primary importance; however, its detection is complicated by several facts including not exactly identifiable periods of quiescence and progression of atherosclerotic process. One of populations, study of which could add valuable information regarding this problem, are women in menopausal transition. Previously unsuccessful therapy with hormone replacement therapy is restudied with focus on the time of/after menopause. Now, it is supposed to be favorable in women soon, approximately less than 8 years, after menopause. In addition, the same principle - optimal timing of the intervention of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, especially lipids, could be also of importance. Therefore, menopausal transition could be optimal period for the intervention in women at risk. However, this approach is to be proved by evidence from controlled prospective studies focused on lifestyle and/or pharmacological intervention."

Indeed, an increasing number of Web-based interventions have recently been developed and tested in health care fields. Despite the great potential for Web-based interventions to improve practice and research, little is known about the current status of Web-based interventions, especially those related to menopause. To identify the current status of Web-based interventions used in the field of menopause, a literature review was conducted using multiple databases, with the keywords ""online,"" ""Internet,"" ""Web,"" ""intervention,"" and ""menopause."" Using these keywords, a total of 18 eligible articles were analyzed to identify the current status of Web-based interventions for menopause.

Based on these findings, directions for future Web -based interventions for menopause are provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
2126,Medical , Menopause  , CYP19A1; estradiol; genetic variation; aromatase inhibitors; patient outcome; breast cancer; endometrial cancer; pleiotropy        ,"After menopause, estradiol is primarily synthesized in peripheral tissues by the enzyme aromatase, encoded by CYP19A1. CYP19A1 variation associates with circulating estradiol in postmenopausal women and this variation is best represented by the intronic variant rs727479. This variation appears to have pleiotropic effects as it also associates with endometrial cancer risk. Indeed, estradiol plays an important role in the development of breast and endometrial cancer. Aromatase inhibitor (AI) drugs are used in the treatment of both diseases, however, response rates for AIs are low and there is currently no way to identify breast or endometrial cancer patients who are more likely to receive a clinical benefit. Multiple studies have proposed that genetic variation in CYP19A1 will have effects on AI efficacy: eight candidate variant studies of sample size greater than 50 describe associations between CYP19A1 variation and the outcome of patients treated with AIs. Nominally significant associations with patient outcome were reported for several variants, including rs727479. However, only an association between rs4646 and time to progression was replicated in an independent study. Moreover, rs4646 is also the only variant that has an association with patient outcome that passes a multiple testing threshold and this variant is in linkage disequilibrium with rs727479, supporting the hypothesis that associations with patient outcome may be driven through the effects on circulating estradiol. Despite this preliminary evidence, well phenotyped and comprehensively genotyped patient sets need to be studied before conclusions can be drawn about the effects of CYP19A1 variation on AI efficacy."

Long-term cyclic 17 beta-estradiol treatment rescues cognitive deficits in aged ovariectomized rhesus monkeys while restoring highly plastic synapses. Here we tested whether distributions of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) within monkey layer III dlPFC synapses are sensitive to age and estradiol, and coupled to cognitive function. Ovariectomized young and aged monkeys administered vehicle or estradiol were first tested on a delayed response test of working memory. Then, quantitative serial section immunoelectron microscopy was used to determine the distributions of synaptic GPER1. GPER1-containing nonperforated axospinous synapse density was reduced with age, and partially restored with estrogen treatment. The majority of synapses expressed GPER1, which was predominately localized to presynaptic cytoplasm and mitochondria. GPER1 was also abundant at plasmalemmas, and within cytoplasmic and postsynaptic density (PSD) domains of dendritic spines. GPER1 levels did not differ with age or treatment, and none of the variables examined were tightly associated with cognitive function. However, greater representation of GPER1 subjacent to the PSD accompanied higher synapse density. These data suggest that GPER1 is positioned to support diverse functions key to synaptic plasticity in monkey dlPFC."
2367,Medical , Migraine  , Binding affinity; CGRP receptor; Schild plot; Gepants; Brain; Mesenteric arteries        ,"Aim: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is found in afferent sensory nerve fibers innervating the resistance arteries and plays a pivotal role in a number of neurovascular diseases such as migraine and subarachnoid bleedings. The present study investigates the binding and antagonistic characteristics of small non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e. gepants) in isolated rat brain and mesenteric resistance arteries. Methods: The antagonistic behavior of gepants was investigated in isolated rat mesenteric arteries using a wire myograph setup while binding of gepants to CGRP receptors was investigated in rat brain membranes using a radioligand competitive binding assay. Furthermore, the histological location of the key components of CGRP receptor (RAMP1 and CLR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Our functional studies clearly show that all gepants are reversible competitive antagonists producing Schild plot slopes not significantly different from unity and thus suggesting presence of a uniform CGRP receptor population in the arteries. A uniform receptor population was also confirmed by radioligand competitive binding studies showing similar affinities for the gepants in rat brain and mesenteric arteries, the exception being rimegepant which had 50-fold lower affinity in brain than mesenteric arteries. CLR and RAMP1 were shown to be located in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: The present results indicate that, despite species differences in the CGRP receptor affinity, the antagonistic nature of these gepants, the distribution pattern of CGRP receptor components and the mechanism behind CGRP-induced vasodilation seem to be similar in resistance-sized arteries of human and rats.

Methods: One hundred patients and 46 matched HCs were recruited. Migraineurs were randomized to verum acupuncture, sham acupuncture, and waiting list groups. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected before and after longitudinal treatments. Independent component analysis was applied in the data analysis. Results: We found that migraineurs showed decreased rs-fc between the rFPN and bilateral precuneus compared with HCs. After treatments (real and sham), rFPN rs-fc with the precuneus was significantly reduced. This reduction was associated with headache intensity relief. In order to explore the role of the precuneus in acupuncture modulation, we performed a seed-based rs-fc analysis using the precuneus as a seed and found that the precuneus rs-fc with the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was significantly enhanced after treatment. Conclusion: Our results suggest that migraineurs are associated with abnormal rFPN rs-fc. An effective treatment, such as acupuncture, may relieve symptoms by strengthening the cognitive adaptation/coping process. Elucidation of the adaptation/coping mechanisms may open up a new window for migraine management."

However, relationship between stroke incidence and triptan use is unclear, and it is unknown whether acute or chronic use of these drugs worsens ischemic brain injury. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of clinically-relevant doses of the potent cerebral artery vasoconstrictor eletriptan on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain infarct volumes, as well as on expression of genes involved in cerebrovascular regulation. We report that acute treatment of rats or mice with eletriptan did not reduce basal CBF, which promptly dropped upon treatment with prazosin or dihydroergotamine. Acute of chronic (1 month) eletriptan also did not affect CBF changes and infarct volumes in mice undergoing brain ischemia/reperfusion. Finally, chronic eletriptan reduced brain mRNAs for PACAP and VIP, leaving unaffected those for 5HT1(B/D)R and CGRP. No significant transcript changes were found in dura mater. Data suggest that the impact of triptans on cerebral hemodynamic should be re-evaluated, as well as their propensity to increase stroke risk in migraineurs. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We found that the dose range from 10 fg to 1000 ng (intradermal) of sumatriptan induced a complex dose-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia in male rats, with distinct peaks, at 1 pg and 10 ng, but no hyperalgesia at 1 ng. In contrast, in females, there was 1 broad peak. The highest dose (1000 ng) did not produce hyperalgesia in either sex. We evaluated the receptors mediating sumatriptan hyperalgesia (1 pg, 1 and 10 ng). In males, the injection of an antagonist for the serotonin (5 HT) receptor subtype 1B (5-HT1B), but not 5-HT1D, markedly inhibited sumatriptan (1 pg)-induced hyperalgesia, at 10 ng a 5-HT1D receptor antagonist completely eliminated hyperalgesia. In contrast, in females, the 5-HT1D, but not 5-HT1B, receptor antagonist completely blocked sumatriptan (1 pg and 10 ng) hyperalgesia and both 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor antagonists attenuated hyperalgesia (1 ng) in females, which is GPR30 estrogen receptor dependent. While selective 5-HT1D, or 5-HT1B, agonists produce robust hyperalgesia in female and male rats, respectively, when co-injected the hyperalgesia induced in both sexes was attenuated. Mechanical hyperalgesia induced by sumatriptan (1 pg and 10 ng) is dependent on the G-protein alpha(i) subunit and protein kinase A (PKA), in IB4-positive and negative nociceptors. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the complex dose dependence for triptan hyperalgesia may provide useful information for the design of anti-migraine drugs with improved therapeutic profiles.

This paper explores a temporal analysis of the patterns of stress, as well as an analysis of momentary and retrospective stress-related symptoms compared by level of headache activity. Adolescent girls (N=31) ages 14-18 were randomly cued by electronic diaries 7 times per day over a 21day period responding to momentary questions about level of head pain, perceived stress and stress-related symptoms. Multivariate general linear modelling was used to determine significant differences among headache groups in relation to temporal patterns of stress. Significant headache group differences were found on retrospective and momentary stress-related symptom measures. A total of 2841 diary responses captured stress levels, head pain and related symptoms. The chronic headache (CH) group reported the highest levels of hourly and daily stress, followed by the moderate headache (MH) and low headache (LH) groups. Patterns of stress for the three headache groups were statistically distinct, illustrating increased stress in girls with more frequent head pain. This evidence suggests that because of increased stress, girls with recurrent head pain are likely a vulnerable population who may benefit from stress-reducing interventions.

METHODS: Mice were randomly divided into seven groups: control group, model group, three different density gypenosides monotherapy, methylprednisolone monotherapy, combination of gypenosides and methylprednisolone group. The control group was subcutaneously injected with oil emulsion adjuvant and all other groups were subcutaneously immunized with an emulsified mixture of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 3555 peptide to induce EAON. Mice in the gypenosides groups were administered injections daily with three concentrations (15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg) of gypenosides respectively. Mice in the methylprednisolone group and the combination treatment group were injected daily with methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) or methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) + gypenosides (30 mg/kg), respectively. After MOG immunization, visual evoked potential (VEP), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and histopathologic examination were performed at 14, 20, 30, and 40d post-inoculation (p.i.).All results were expressed as mean +/- SEM. The data were evaluated by oneway ANOVA followed by Tukey or Games-Howell test. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, p2 latency was prolonged in the model group (P=0.041). Combination treatment can alleviated the change in VEP at 20d p.i. (P=0.012). Average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was reduced in the model group (P= 0.000, 30d; P=0.000, 40d) and gypenosides treatment remarkably diminished the degree of RNFL degeneration at 30d and 40d p.i (P=0.000, 30d; P=0.000, 40d). The pathomorphological results showed a decrease in demyelination (P=0.020) and inflammatory reactions in the combination group compared with the model group (20d p.i.). Gypenosides treatment also alleviated the degree of axonal loss (40d p.i.) (P=0.003). CONCLUSION: Treatment with gypenosides exerts protective effects on retinal nerve fibers and axons in EAON. When combined with gypenosides, methylprednisolone reduces demyelination in the acute stage of EAON."

To explore and describe how young adults between 18-25 years of age experienced growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis and how these experiences continue to influence their daily lives. Background. Chronic parental illness is occurring in about 10% of families worldwide, but little is known about how the children experience growing up with a parent with multiple sclerosis during their childhood and into young adulthood. Design. We chose a qualitative design using a phenomenological approach based on Giorgi. Methods. Exploratory and open-ended interviews with 14 young adults were conducted. Results. The essence of the phenomenon of having a parent with multiple sclerosis was synthesized into 'Striving for balance between caring and restraint' from two themes 'caring' and 'restraint' and eight subthemes. Participants' experiences of caring for parents with multiple sclerosis continued influencing their other close relationships, in which they tended to assume responsibility while concealing some of their feelings and desires. Most participants showed restraint among parents with and without multiple sclerosis, friends and partners. Conclusion. It seems that one of the greatest challenges of having a parent with multiple sclerosis is achieving a balance between caring for others and asserting one's own desires. Relevance to clinical practice. Healthcare professionals can support the family by encouraging family members to participate in consultations and to assist the parents in providing information about multiple sclerosis and its symptoms to the children. Parents might need assistance in applying for help with domestic chores or referrals to support groups for their children or other family members."
2596,Medical , Multiple Sclerosis  , Nrf2; HO-1; sickle cell disease; haptoglobin; hemopexin        ,"Aims: Heme derived from hemolysis is pro-oxidative and proinflammatory and promotes vaso-occlusion in murine models of sickle cell disease (SCD), suggesting that enhanced detoxification of heme may be beneficial. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) transcription pathway is the principal cellular defense system responding to pro-oxidative and proinflammatory stress. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a drug approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis, provides neuroprotection by activating Nrf2-responsive genes. We hypothesized that induction of Nrf2 with DMF would be beneficial in murine SCD models. Results: DMF (30mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.08% methyl cellulose) was administered for 3-7 days to NY1DD and HbSS-Townes SCD mice. Vaso-occlusion, a hallmark of SCD, measured in sickle mice with dorsal skinfold chambers, was inhibited by DMF. The inhibitory effect of DMF was abrogated by the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor tin protoporphyrin. DMF increased nuclear Nrf2 and cellularmRNAofNrf2-responsive genes in livers and kidneys. DMF increased heme defenses, including HO-1, haptoglobin, hemopexin, and ferritin heavy chain, although plasma hemoglobin and heme levels were unchanged. DMF decreased markers of inflammation, including nuclear factor-kappa B phospho-p65, adhesion molecules, and toll-like receptor 4. DMF administered for 24 weeks to HbSS-Townesmice decreased hepatic necrosis, inflammatory cytokines, and irregularly shaped erythrocytes and increased hemoglobin F, but did not alter hematocrits, reticulocyte counts, lactate dehydrogenase, plasma heme, or spleen weights, indicating that the beneficial effects of DMF were not attributable to decreased hemolysis. Innovation: These studies identify Nrf2 activation as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of SCD. Conclusion: DMF activates Nrf2, enhances antioxidant defenses, and inhibits inflammation and vaso-occlusion in SCD mice."

Materials and methods: This study included respondents to the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis Registry spring 2015 update survey who were US or Canadian residents, aged 18-65 years and reported having relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), or primary progressive MS (PPMS). The RRMS and SPMS participants were combined to form the relapsing-onset MS (RMS) group and compared with the PPMS group regarding employment status, absenteeism, and disability. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between employment-related outcomes and factors that may affect these relationships. Results: Of the 8004 survey respondents, 5887 (73.6%) were 18-65 years of age. The PPMS group (n=344) had a higher proportion of males and older mean age at the time of the survey and at time of diagnosis than the RMS group (n=4829). Female sex, age, age at diagnosis, cognitive and hand function impairment, fatigue, higher disability levels, >= 3 comorbidities, and a diagnosis of PPMS were associated with not working. After adjustment for disability, the employed PPMS sub-group reported similar levels of absenteeism to the employed RMS sub-group. Limitations: Limitations of the study include self-report of information and the possibility that participants may not fully represent the working-age MS population. Conclusions: In MS, employment status and absenteeism are negatively affected by disability, cognitive impairment, and fatigue. These findings underscore the need for therapies that prevent disability progression and other symptoms that negatively affect productivity in persons with MS to enable them to persist in the workforce."
2540,Medical , Myelofibrosis  , MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASE; APOPTOSIS; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY        ,"Aims Megakaryocyte expansion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is due to uncontrolled proliferation accompanied by dysregulation of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mechanisms. Here we have investigated the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways of megakaryocytes in human MPNs to further define the mechanisms involved. Methods The megakaryocytic expression of proapoptotic caspase-8, caspase-9, Diablo, p53 and antiapoptotic survivin proteins was investigated in bone marrow specimens of the MPNs (n=145) and controls (n=15) using immunohistochemistry. The megakaryocyte percentage positivity was assessed by light microscopy and correlated with the MPN entity, JAK2(V617F)/CALR mutation status and platelet count. Results The proportion of megakaryocytes in the MPNs expressing caspase-8, caspase-9, Diablo, survivin and p53 was significantly greater than controls. A greater proportion of myeloproliferative megakaryocytes expressed survivin relative to its reciprocal inhibitor, Diablo. Differences were seen between myelofibrosis, polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia for caspase-9 and p53. CALR-mutated cases had greater megakaryocyte p53 positivity compared to those with the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Proapoptotic caspase-9 expression showed a positive correlation with platelet count, which was most marked in myelofibrosis and CALR-mutated cases. Conclusions Disruptions targeting the intrinsic apoptotic cascade promote megakaryocyte hyperplasia and thrombocytosis in the MPNs. There is progressive dysfunction of apoptosis as evidenced by the marked reduction in proapoptotic caspase-9 and accumulation of p53 in myelofibrosis. The dysfunction of caspase-9, which is necessary for proplatelet formation, may be the mechanism for the excess thrombocytosis associated with CALR mutations. Survivin seems to be the key protein mediating the megakaryocyte survival signature in the MPNs and is a potential therapeutic target."
2889,Medical , Myelofibrosis  , Anti-thymocyte globulin; Bilirubin; Hepatic toxicity; Myelofibrosis; Hematopoietic cell transplantation        ,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remains the only curative treatment option for myelofibrosis (MF) despite the emergence of novel targeted therapies. To reduce graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), current allo-HCT protocols often include in vivo T lymphocyte depletion using polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Shortly after ATG administration, an immediate inflammatory response with fever, chills, and laboratory alterations such as cytopenias, elevation of serum C-reactive protein, bilirubin, and transaminases can develop. Here, we explore whether MF patients, who commonly exhibit extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, might be particularly susceptible to ATG-induced liver toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 130 control and 94 MF patients from three transplant centers treated with or without ATG during the allo-HCT conditioning regimen. Indeed, hyperbilirubinemia was found in nearly every MF patient treated with ATG (MF-ATG 54/60 = 90 %) as compared to non-ATG treated MF (MF-noATG 15/34 = 44.1 %, p < 0.001) and respectively ATG-treated non-MF patients of the control group (control-ATG, 43/77 = 56 %, p < 0.001). In contrast, transaminases were only inconsistently elevated. Hyperbilirubinemia was in most cases self-limiting and not predictive of increased incidence of non-relapse mortality, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) or liver GvHD. In sum, awareness of this stereotypic bilirubin elevation in MF patients treated with ATG provides a relatively benign explanation for hyperbilirubinemia occurring in these patients during the early transplant. However, attention to drug levels of biliary excreted drugs is warranted, since altered bile flow may influence their clearance and enhance toxicity (e.g., busulfan, antifungal agents)."
2891,Medical , Myelofibrosis  , Myelofibrosis; Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen        ,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the sole curative option for myelofibrosis. Many transplantation recipients receive a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen owing to age or comorbidities; however, there is little published evidence to guide the choice of RIC regimen. In this study, we compared outcomes in patients who received 1 of 2 frequently used RIC regimens for patients with myelofibrosis: fludarabine-busulfan (FB) and fludarabine-melphalan (FM). A total of 160 patients underwent a RIC allograft procedure (FB group, n = 105; FM group, n = 55). We have developed a complex statistical model involving weighting and adjustment to permit comparison between these 2 groups. After weighting, the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 62% in the FM group and 31% in the FB group (P = .001), and the corresponding incidence of chronic GVHD was 49% and 53%, respectively. The 7-year progression-free survival was were 52% in the FM group versus 33% in the FB group, and the 7-year overall survival rate 52% in the FM group versus 59% in the FB group. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 43% in the FM group and 31% in the FB group. Multivariable analyses revealed no significant differences in PFS between the 2 groups; however, the relapse rate was significantly lower in the FM group (hazard ratio, 9.21; P = .008), whereas a trend toward reduced NRM was seen in the FB group (hazard ratio, 0.51; P = .068). In conclusion, both regimens appear to be efficient in mediating disease control and can be used to successfully condition patients with myelofibrosis. The FM regimen appears to induce more NRM than the FB regimen, but with augmented control of disease, leading to comparable overall survival rates for both regimens.

2892,Medical , Myelofibrosis  , primary myelofibrosis; treosulfan; reduced-toxicity conditioning; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; bone marrow transplantation; myeloproliferative disease        ,"Allogeneic transplantation is the only potentially curative strategy for myelofibrosis, even in the era of new drugs that so far only mitigate symptoms. The choice to proceed to allogeneic transplantation is based on several variables including age, disease phase, degree of splenomegaly, donor availability, comorbidities and iron overload. These factors, along with conditioning regimen and time to transplantation, may influence the outcome of ASCT. We report 14 patients affected by myelofibrosis with a median age of 57 years (range, 41-76) receiving a treosulfan-fludarabine based reduced toxicity conditioning. Patients (pts) received a stem cell transplantation from an HLA identical (n = 10) or matched unrelated donor (n = 4). All pts had a complete myeloablation followed by engraftment and in 12 out of 13 evaluated pts donor chimerism was 100% at 1 month. In most cases a reduction of splenomegaly and a reduction (or resolution) of bone marrow fibrosis was observed. After a median follow-up of 39 months (range, 3-106), the 3-year probability of overall survival and disease free survival was 54 +/- 14% and 46 +/- 14%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at 2 years was 39 +/- 15%. Causes of non-relapse mortality were: infection (n = 2), GvHD (n = 2) and haemorrhage (n = 1). We can conclude that a treosulfan and fludarabine based conditioning has a potent myeloablative and anti-disease activity although non-relapse mortality remains high in this challenging clinical setting.

2909,Medical , Myelofibrosis  , circulating CD34(+) cells; myelofibrosis; inflammatory microenvironment; migration; survival        ,"Along with molecular abnormalities (mutations in JAK2, Calreticulin (CALR) and MPL genes), chronic inflammation is the major hallmark of Myelofibrosis (MF). Here, we investigated the in vitro effects of crucial factors of the inflammatory microenvironment (Interleukin (IL)-1 beta, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 and ATP) on the functional behaviour of MF-derived circulating CD34(+) cells. We found that, regardless mutation status, IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha increases the survival of MF-derived CD34(+) cells. In addition, along with stimulation of cell cycle progression to the S-phase, IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha +/- TIMP-1 significantly stimulate(s) the in vitro clonogenic ability of CD34(+) cells from JAK2(V617) mutated patients. Whereas in the JAK2(V617F) mutated group, the addition of IL-1 beta or TNF-alpha +/- TIMP-1 decreased the erythroid compartment of the CALR mutated patients. Megakaryocyte progenitors were stimulated by IL-1 beta (JAK2(V617F) mutated patients only) and inhibited by TNF-alpha. IL-1 beta + TNF-alpha + C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) +/- TIMP-1 highly stimulates the in vitro migration of MF-derived CD34+ cells. Interestingly, after migration toward IL-1 beta + TNF-alpha + CXCL12 +/- TIMP-1, CD34(+) cells from JAK2(V617F) mutated patients show increased clonogenic ability. Here we demonstrate that the interplay of these inflammatory factors promotes and selects the circulating MF-derived CD34(+) cells with higher proliferative activity, clonogenic potential and migration ability. Targeting these micro-environmental interactions may be a clinically relevant approach."

Our aim was to define the molecular alterations underlying metastasis formation. Gene expression profiling was performed using microarray and qRT-PCR to define alterations between matched primary and metastatic melanoma cell lines. These data were integrated with publicly available unmatched tissue data. The invasiveness of cell lines was determined by Matrigel invasion assays and invasive clones from primary melanoma-derived cell lines were also selected. Two metastatic cell line models were created: the regional lymph node WM983A-WM983A(INV)-WM983B and the distant lung WM793B-WM793B(INV)-1205Lu metastatic models. The majority of metastasis genes were downregulated and enriched in adhesion and ITGA6-B4 pathways. Upregulation of immune pathways was characteristic of distant metastases, whereas increased Rap1 signaling was specific for regional (sub) cutaneous metastases. qRT-PCR analysis of selected integrins (A2, A3, A4, A9, B5, B8, A6, B1, and B3) highlighted the possible importance of ITGA3/4 and B8 in the metastatic process, distinguishing regional and distant metastases. We identified functionally relevant gene clusters that influenced metastasis formation. Our data provide further evidence that integrin expression patterns may be important in distant metastasis formation. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

And the fabricated process of immunosensor was investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectra (ATR-FTIR), static water contact angles, scanning electron microscope (SEM), cyclic voltammetty (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical performances of the AFP immunosensor were studied. Results indicated the prepared HBPE-NO2-modified immunosensor showed excellent electrochemical properties and satisfactory accuracy for the detection of AFP of the real clinical samples that attributed to the properties of the HBPE-NO2 NPs, which had nanosized structure to increase the specific surface area and unique chemical reactivity for loading capacity of protein molecules.

AgNC is first synthesized around C-rich template DNA and the resulting DNA-AgNC binds to GO through the interaction between the extension DNA and GO. The resulting DNA-AgNC/GO would show quite reduced fluorescence signal because the fluorescence from DNA-AgNCs is quenched by GO. In the presence of DNase I, however, it degrades the DNA strand within DNA/RNA hybrid duplex probe employed in this study, consequently releasing RNA which is complementary to the extension DNA. The released free RNA then extracts DNA-AgNC from GO by hybridizing with the extension DNA bound to GO. This process would restore the quenched fluorescence, emitting highly enhanced fluorescence signal. By employing this assay principle, DNase I activity was reliably identified with a detection limit of 0.10 U/ml which is lower than those from previous fluorescence-based methods. Finally, the practical capability of this assay system was successfully demonstrated by its use to determine DNase I activity in bovine urine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Study of PTOA is typically performed in vivo with replicate animals using artificially induced injury features. The goal of this work was to measure changes in a joint contact stress in the knee of a large quadruped after creation of a clinically realistic overload injury and a focal cartilage defect. Whole-joint overload was achieved by excising a 5-mm wedge of the anterior medial meniscus. Focal cartilage defects were created using a custom pneumatic impact gun specifically developed and mechanically characterized for this work. To evaluate the effect of these injuries on joint contact mechanics, Tekscan (Tekscan, Inc., South Boston, MA) measurements were obtained pre-operatively, postmeniscectomy, and postimpact (1.2-J) in a nonrandomized group of axially loaded cadaveric sheep knees. Postmeniscectomy, peak contact stress in the medial compartment is increased by 71% (p = 0.03) and contact area is decreased by 35% (p = 0.001); the center of pressure (CoP) shifted toward the cruciate ligaments in both the medial (p = 0.004) and lateral (p = 0.03) compartments. The creation of a cartilage defect did not significantly change any aspect of contact mechanics measured in the meniscectomized knee.

Seventeen older subjects with acromegaly (67 [63-73] years) and 20 paired control subjects were evaluated with balance scales, force platform, and knee isokinetic dynamometry tests. There were significant differences between the groups on several balance and gait scales, with a worse performance and greater risk of falls in the acromegalic older adults. Acromegalic older adults had lower values for peak torque, maximum repetition of the total work, and total work during extension at 240 degrees/s. The acromegalic older adults had higher values in the medial-lateral range. Acromegaly subjects had lateral instability that compromises their body balance and increases the risk of falls.

In this study, the possibility to modulate the behavior of macrophages activated by biomaterials. was assessed in an in vitro model. Primary human monocytes were seeded on polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene and polylactic acid yarns, and treated with medications frequently used by patients: rapamycin, dexamethasone, celecoxib or pravastatin. Modulation of the adhering macrophages with rapamycin resulted in a generally pro-inflammatory effect. Dexamethasone caused an overall anti-inflammatory effect on the macrophages cultured on either material, while celecoxib only affected macrophages adhering to polyethylene terephthalate and polylactic acid. Pravastatin increased the. pro-inflammatory genes of macrophages cultured on polypropylene and polylactic acid. Pairwise comparison revealed that macrophages adhering to polylactic acid seemed to be more susceptible to phenotype modulation than when adhering to polypropylene or polyethylene terephthalate. The. data show. that macrophages activated by the biomaterials can be modulated, yet the degree of the modulatory capacity depends on the type of material.

In contrast to the majority of previously reported research, this study also focuses on the characteristic non-circular femoral neck cross-sectional geometry and variation in bone mineral density (BMD) around the femoral neck. Twenty-two osteoarthritic and 7 osteoporotic femoral neck slices, collected from elective and trauma-related arthroplasty, and 16 cadaveric donor tissue controls were tested mechanically using Reference Point Indentation (BioDent (TM), Active Life Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA) and then scanned with in vitro-based radiography intended to replicate the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry technique. All parameters were measured regionally around the circumference of the femoral neck, allowing examination of spatial variability within the cortical bone. Fractured tissue was less resistant to indentation in the thinner superolateral segment compared to other segments and other groups. BMD around the fractured femoral necks appeared more consistent than that of nonfractured tissue, where BMD was reduced in the superolateral segment for the other groups. Cortical bone was thin in the superolateral segment for all groups except for the osteoarthritic group, and was thicker in the inferomedial segment for both osteoarthritic and fractured groups, resulting in the largest variation in buckling ratio (ratio of cortical bone diameter to cortical bone thickness) around the femoral neck for the fractured group. With age, healthy controls appeared to have lower inferomedial cortical thickness, whereas no significant differences in Reference Point Indentation measurements and density were observed. The study has highlighted several (both quality- and quantity-related) parameters that may be used to improve prediction of fracture risk."

MethodsOur series consisted of children with oJIA, as defined by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria, for whom complete clinical data of at least 2 years' duration were available. Clinical and laboratory data, collected at disease onset and at the last follow-up, included: sex, age, presence of JH according to the Beighton score, disease activity, presence of uveitis, ANA, treatment and outcome. ResultsA total of 274 oligoarticular JIA patients (224 female, 50 male; mean age: 11.5) followed on average for 6.6 years, entered the study. The mean age at disease onset was 4.9 years, ANA were positive in 83.9% and uveitis occurred in 20.8%. JH was present in 70.8% of cases at onset, in 44.5% at the last evaluation. JH was more frequent in females (73.7%) than in males (58.0%) (P = 0.028). Uveitis was less frequent in hypermobile children both at diagnosis (17.5 vs. 28.7%, P = 0.037) and during overall disease course (23.7 vs. 36.3%, P = 0.034). Of 163 subjects with at least 5-year follow-up, the full clinical remission rate was significantly higher in JH patients (50.5%) than in those without JH (42.3%; P = 0.042).

Purpose/introduction The investigation and treatment of osteoporosis after minimal trauma fracture (MTF) is regarded as sub-optimal. There is strong evidence of the benefit of identifying and treating osteoporosis after MTF, and there has been discussion of the possible role that orthopedic surgeons might play in the management of osteoporosis after MTF. The study surveyed orthopedic surgeons in rural and regional Southeast Australia to determine their attitudes to investigation and management of osteoporosis, the role health professionals should play, and the communication and coordination of follow-up care. Methods A survey was developed and piloted prior to being posted to 69 orthopedic surgeons asking for their opinions about the general management of osteoporosis, and the roles and responsibilities of health professionals in dealing with osteoporosis following an MTF. Results Responses were received from 42 participants (60.8%) with the majority of respondents agreeing that it is important to treat osteoporosis following MTF. Less than 15% of respondents felt that it was their responsibility to initiate discussion or treatment or investigation after MTF. No respondent felt that the coordination of osteoporosis care was good and 45% stated it was poor. Communication after discharge is mostly left to the hospital (30%), while 20% stated they did not follow up at all. This study shows that many rural orthopedic surgeons believe that follow-up in regard to osteoporosis after MTF is important, that responsibility for follow-up diagnosis and management of osteoporosis lies with primary health care and the current communication systems are poor."

Its relationship to cannabinoid signaling in bone cells implies its use could affect bone mineral density (BMD) in the population. In a national survey of people ages 20-59, we found no association between self-reported cannabis use and BMD of the hip or spine. Introduction Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in the USA, and its recreational use has recently been approved in several US states. Cannabinoids play a role in bone homeostasis. We aimed to determine the association between cannabis use and BMD in US adults. Methods In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2010, 4743 participants between 20 and 59 years old, history of cannabis use was categorized into never, former (previous use, but not in last 30 days), light (1-4 days of use in last 30 days), and heavy (>= 5 days of use in last 30 days). Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between cannabis use and DXA BMD of the proximal femur and lumbar spine with adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and race/ethnicity among other BMD determinants. Results Sixty percent of the population reported ever using cannabis; 47% were former users, 5% were light users, and 7% were heavy users. Heavy cannabis users were more likely to be male, have a lower BMI, increased daily alcohol intake, increased tobacco pack-years, andweremore likely to have used other illegal drugs (cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines). No association between cannabis and BMD was observed for any level of use (p >= 0.28). Conclusions A history of cannabis use, although highly prevalent and related to other risk factors for low BMD, was not independently associated with BMD in this cross-sectional study of American men and women."

Search rates increased from 2004 until 2010 and thereafter displayed a seasonal pattern peaking in late winter. This knowledge could help guide the timing of public health interventions aimed at managing vitamin D deficiency. Purpose The Internet is an important source of health information. Analysis of Internet search activity rates can provide information on disease epidemiology, health related behaviors and public interest. We explored Internet search rates for vitamin D to determine whether this reflects the increasing scientific interest in this topic. Methods Google Trends is a publically available tool that provides data on Internet searches using Google. Search activity for the term ""vitamin D"" from 1st January 2004 until 31st October 2016 was obtained. Comparison was made to other bone and nutrition related terms. Results Worldwide, searches for ""vitamin D"" increased from 2004 until 2010 and thereafter a statistically significant (p < 0.001) seasonal pattern with a peak in February and nadir in August was observed. This seasonal pattern was evident for searches originating from both the USA (peak in February) and Australia (peak in August); p < 0.001 for both. Searches for the terms ""osteoporosis"", ""rickets"", ""back pain"" or ""folic acid"" did not display the increase observed for vitamin D or evidence of seasonal variation. Conclusion Public interest in vitamin D, as assessed by Internet search activity, did increase from 2004 to 2010, likely reflecting the growing scientific interest, but now displays a seasonal pattern with peak interest during late winter. This information could be used to guide public health approaches to managing vitamin D deficiency."

Quantitative CBCT indices can be used to screen for women with low BMD. Purpose Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by the deterioration of bone tissue and the consequent decrease in BMD and increase in bone fragility. Several studies have been performed to assess radiometric indices in panoramic images as low-BMD predictors. The aim of this study is to correlate radiometric indices from CBCT images and BMD in postmenopausal women. Methods Sixty postmenopausal women with indications for dental implants and CBCT evaluation were selected. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed, and the patients were divided into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Cross-sectional images were used to evaluate the computed tomography mandibular index (CTMI), the computed tomography index (inferior) (CTI (I)) and computed tomography index (superior) (CTI (S)). Student's t test was used to compare the differences between the indices of the groups' intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Statistical analysis showed a high degree of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for all measurements (ICC >0.80). The mean values of CTMI, CTI (S), and CTI (I) were lower in the osteoporosis group than in osteopenia and normal patients (p < 0.05). In comparing normal patients and women with osteopenia, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean value of CTI (I) (p = 0.075). Conclusions Quantitative CBCT indices may help dentists to screen for women with low spinal and femoral bone mineral density so that they can refer postmenopausal women for bone densitometry."

In this study, we found no significant differences in short-term functional recovery between femoral neck fracture patients who received bisphosphonate treatment at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Introduction Bisphosphonate is the mainstay therapy for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate initiation on short-term functional recovery in femoral neck fracture patients at 2 versus 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. Methods One hundred patients were randomly allocated into two groups in a parallel group designed, randomized, controlled trial. Both groups received risedronate 35 mg/week at either 2 or 12 weeks after hemiarthroplasty. All patients received calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Functional recovery was assessed by de Morton Mobility Index, Barthel Index, EuroQol 5D, visual analog scale, 2-min walk test, and timed get-up-and-go test at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. Results At the 3-month follow-up, all functional outcome measures showed significant improvement in both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the functional outcomes between groups at both the 3-month and 1-year follow-ups. Although patients who received bisphosphonate initiation at week 2 had lower serum calcium level at 3 months and more overall adverse events than patients in the week 12 group, no patients in either group discontinued their prescribed medications. Conclusions While underpowered, the findings of this study suggest that there were no significant differences in short-term functional recovery or significant adverse events between the two bisphosphonate groups. Thus, the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy may be considered as early as 2 weeks after femoral neck fracture. It is important that low serum calcium and vitamin D status must be corrected with calcium and vitamin D supplementation prior to or at the time of bisphosphonate initiation.

2356,Medical , Overactive Bladder  , BMI; frequency volume chart; hypertension; nocturia        ,"Aim: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical features of patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS) and investigate the impact of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP) treatment on nocturnal urine volume. Materials and Methods: This study enrolled 53 patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS and an apnea-hypoxia index of >20/hr. Data were collected on serum brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP) level, International Prostate Symptom Score-Quality of Life ( IPSS-QOL) score, Overactive Bladder Symptom Score ( OABSS), International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Nocturia QOL ( ICIQ-NQOL) score, Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS) score, and the frequency volume chart. Only patients who continued CPAP treatment for 3 months were included in the analysis. Results: In total, 40 patients ( 33 men and 7 women) completed the study ( 75.5%). The mean age was 56.9 years. The night-time frequency to void was significantly decreased from 2.1 to 1.2 after CPAP treatment ( P<0.01). The mean scores as assessed by ESS, IPSS-QOL, OABSS, and ICIQ-NQOL significantly improved after CPAP ( P<0.01). The mean diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased after CPAP treatment. However, there was no significant change in the BNP level before and after CPAP treatment. In the frequency volume chart, hours of undisturbed sleep, total nocturnal voided volume, and nocturnal polyuria index significantly improved after CPAP treatment ( P<0.05). However, 24-hr voided volume and mean voided volume during night-time did not change after CPAP treatment. Conclusion: CPAP treatment decreases night-time urinary frequency by reducing nocturnal urine production and improves QOL in patients with OSAS. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
2360,Medical , Overactive Bladder  , tolterodine; veratridine; ventricular myocytes; late sodium current; reverse-Na+/Ca2+ exchange current; early afterdepolarization; arrhythmia; cardioprotection        ,"Aim: The augmentation of late sodium current (I-Na.L) not only causes intracellular Na+ accumulation, which results in intracellular Ca2+ overload via the reverse mode of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange current (reverse-I-NCX), but also prolongs APD and induces early afterdepolarizations (EAD), which can lead to arrhythmia and cardiac dysfunction. Thus, the inhibition of I-Na.L is considered to be a potential way for therapeutic intervention in ischemia and heart failure. In this study we investigated the effects of tolterodine (Tol), a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, on normal and veratridine (Ver)-augmented I-Na.L, reverse-I-NCX and APD in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, which might contribute to its cardioprotective activity. Methods: Rabbit ventricular myocytes were prepared. The I-Na.L and reverse-I-NCX were recorded in voltage clamp mode, whereas action potentials and Ver-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were recorded in current clamp mode. Drugs were applied via superfusion. Results: Tol (3-120 nmol/L) concentration-dependently inhibited the normal and Ver-augmented I-Na.L with IC50 values of 32.08 nmol/L and 42.47 nmol/L, respectively. Atropine (100 mu mol/L) did not affect the inhibitory effects of Tol (30 nmol/L) on Ver-augmented I-Na.L. In contrast, much high concentrations of Tol was needed to inhibit the transient sodium current (I-Na.T) with an IC50 value of 183.03 mu mol/L. In addition, Tol (30 nmol/L) significantly shifted the inactivation curve of I-Na.T toward a more depolarizing membrane potential without affecting its activation characteristics. Moreover, Tol (30 nmol/L) significantly decreased Ver-augmented reverse-I-NCX. Tol (30 nmol/L) increased the action potential duration (APD) by 16% under the basal conditions. Ver (20 mu mol/L) considerably extended the APD and evoked EADs in 18/24 cells (75%). In the presence of Ver, Tol (30 nmol/L) markedly decreased the APD and eliminated EADs (0/24 cells). Conclusion: Tol inhibits normal and Ver-augmented I-NaL and decreases Ver-augmented reverse-I-NCX. In addition, Tol reverses the prolongation of the APD and eliminates the EADs induced by Ver, thus prevents Ver-induced arrhythmia."

Methods: Individuals with chronic SCI and NLUTD presenting for a routine urologic examination at a tertiary urologic referral center were recruited for the study. Patient characteristics, the current bladder evacuation method and urodynamic parameters were collected. As controls, individuals with normal bladder function were recruited from the staff of a SCI rehabilitation center. The urinary NGF concentration was measured in triplicates by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with a minimal sensitivity of 10pg/ml. Results: The data of 10 and 37 individuals with normal bladder function and NLUTD, respectively, were analyzed. The urinary NGF concentration was below 10pg/ml in all investigated samples. Conclusions: The urinary NGF concentration did not differentiate between individuals with normal bladder function and those with NLUTD. At least in patients with SCI, the urinary NGF concentration does not seem to be a clinically relevant biomarker for NLUTD. Neurourol. Urodynam. 36:659-662, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

MethodsThirty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: mesh, sham (no mesh), and control. Urodynamic study and NGF analysis of the urogenital tissues were done and results were compared among all groups. The urodynamic studies of the mesh and sham groups were further divided into the 4th and 10th days. A P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsAll rats survived and no complications were observed during the post-implantation period. Histological evaluation showed intense acute inflammatory reaction on days 4 and 7 in the mesh and sham groups when compared to the control. The mesh group showed a larger area of inflammation as compared to the sham. The NGF levels increased significantly in the mesh and sham groups on the 4th and 10th days when compared to the control (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Both the mesh and sham groups had shorter voiding interval and lower voiding volume on days 4 and 10 when compared to the control group (P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). The magnitude on increasing NGF level and decreasing voiding interval and voiding volume was significantly more on the mesh group than the sham group. ConclusionA higher level of NGF in the early days post-transvaginal mesh implantation is associated with a shorter voiding interval and a smaller bladder capacity, which represents abnormal lower urinary tract symptoms following transvaginal mesh implantation."

The purpose of this study was to create a three dimensional map of the innervation of the human bladder trigone from the extrinsic perivesical adventitial nerve trunks to the urothelium. MethodsA male and a female human bladder were harvested from fresh frozen cadavers and fixed in formalin. The bladder neck and trigone region were serially sectioned (5m) and every 20th slide was stained (S100), scanned and aligned to create 3D maps. ResultsNerve penetration into the detrusor muscle occurs with the highest frequency at the bladder neck and interureteric ridge. Nerves traveling parallel to the bladder lumen do so in the adventitia, beyond the outer border of detrusor. In females, the depth of these nerve bands is uniform at 0.7-1.7cm below the luminal surface, the outer limits of which include the anterior vaginal wall. In the male, depth is more variable owing to detrusor hypertrophy with the minimum depth of nerves approximately 0.5cm near the interureteric ridge and over 1cm near the bladder neck. ConclusionsMyelinated neural pathways traversing in the human bladder in the region of the trigone have a discreet regional density. This 3D map of trigonal innervation may provide guidance to more precisely direct therapies for urinary incontinence or pelvic pain. Neurourol. Urodynam. 36:1015-1019, 2017.

These beliefs are reflected in parents' long-term socialization goals for their children. In this study, we test whether specific themes that have been deemed important in literature on diverse families in the United States (e.g., Strong Black Woman [SBW], marianismo, familismo) are evident in mothers' long-term socialization goals. Participants included 192 mothers of teenage daughters from a low-income city in the United States (58% Latina, 22% African American, and 20% European American [EA]/White). Socialization goals were assessed through a q-sort task on important traits for a woman to possess and content analysis of open-ended responses about what values mothers hoped they would transmit to their daughters as they become adults. Results from ANCOVAs and logistic regression indicate significant racial/ethnic differences on both tasks consistent with hypotheses. On the q-sort task, African American mothers put more importance on women possessing traits such as independence than mothers from other racial/ethnic groups. Similarly, they were more likely to emphasize self-confidence and strength in what they hoped to transmit to their daughters. Contrary to expectation, Latina mothers did not emphasize social traits on the q-sort; however, in open-ended responses, they were more likely to focus on the importance of motherhood, one aspect of marianismo and familismo. Overall, results suggest that these mothers' long-term socialization goals incorporate culturally relevant values considered important for African American and Latino families."
1748,Medical , Parenting  , Schemas; Depression; Parenting; Temperament; Moderated mediation; Early maladaptive schemas        ,"According to the Schema Therapy Model, maladaptive parenting styles interact with a child's unique temperament in the development of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs), which in turn increase one's risk for developing pathology. However, few authors have examined the comprehensive model. The purpose of this study was to assess the indirect effect of perceived parenting styles on depressive symptoms through EMSs. Furthermore, a series of moderated mediation analyses were conducted to examine whether the indirect effect varies as a function of temperament. A total of 403 undergraduate students completed measures of perceived parenting experiences, temperament, EMSs, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the schema domains of disconnection/rejection and impaired autonomy mediated the relationship between perceived parenting styles and depressive symptoms. Moderation of the indirect effect was only found in two of the twelve tested models. This study lends partial support to the Schema Therapy model and also offers a new way of looking at the interactive nature of the constructs."
1978,Medical , Parenting  , Emotion regulation; Heart rate variability; Parenting        ,"Adolescence is a potentially important time in the development of emotion regulation and parenting behaviors may play a role. We examined associations among parenting behaviors, parent resting heart rate variability, adolescent resting heart rate variability and parenting behaviors as moderators of the association between parent and adolescent resting heart rate variability. Ninety-seven youth (11-17 years; 49.5 % female; 34 % African American, 37.1 % Euro-American, 22.6 % other/mixed ethnic background, and 7.2 % Hispanic) and their parents (n = 81) completed a physiological assessment and questionnaires assessing parenting behaviors. Inconsistent discipline and corporal punishment were negatively associated with adolescent resting heart rate variability, while positive parenting and parental involvement were positively associated. Inconsistent discipline and parental involvement moderated the relationship between parent and adolescent resting heart rate variability. The findings provide evidence for a role of parenting behaviors in shaping the development of adolescent resting heart rate variability with inconsistent discipline and parental involvement potentially influencing the entrainment of resting heart rate variability in parents and their children."

Here we hypothesized that adult males' physiological responses to opposite-sex conspecifics' distress result from an interaction between an environmental factor (early social interaction with caregivers) and a genetic factor (a polymorphism within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene, 5-HTTLPR). We assessed heart rate changes in 42 non-married male adults to distress vocalizations (female, infant, and bonobo cries). Males' early interaction with parents was assessed using the Parental Bonding Instrument. Buccal mucosa cell samples were collected to assess their 5-HTTLPR genotype. A significant interaction emerged between early experience and genetic predisposition. Males with a genetic predisposition for higher sensitivity to environmental factors showed atypical physiological responses to adult female cries according to their experienced early maternal parenting. Environmental experiences and genetic characteristics are associated with adult males' physiological responses to socially meaningfully stimuli. Understanding the mechanisms that modulate responses to opposite-sex conspecifics may improve personal well-being and social adaptiveness."
1928,Medical , Parkinson's Disease  , Parkinson's disease; beta oscillations; deep brain stimulation; basal ganglia; closed-loop control        ,"Adaptive deep brain stimulation uses feedback about the state of neural circuits to control stimulation rather than delivering fixed stimulation all the time, as currently performed. In patients with Parkinson's disease, elevations in beta activity (13-35 Hz) in the subthalamic nucleus have been demonstrated to correlate with clinical impairment and have provided the basis for feedback control in trials of adaptive deep brain stimulation. These pilot studies have suggested that adaptive deep brain stimulation may potentially be more effective, efficient and selective than conventional deep brain stimulation, implying mechanistic differences between the two approaches. Here we test the hypothesis that such differences arise through differential effects on the temporal dynamics of beta activity. The latter is not constantly increased in Parkinson's disease, but comes in bursts of different durations and amplitudes. We demonstrate that the amplitude of beta activity in the subthalamic nucleus increases in proportion to burst duration, consistent with progressively increasing synchronization. Effective adaptive deep brain stimulation truncated long beta bursts shifting the distribution of burst duration away from long duration with large amplitude towards short duration, lower amplitude bursts. Critically, bursts with shorter duration are negatively and bursts with longer duration positively correlated with the motor impairment off stimulation. Conventional deep brain stimulation did not change the distribution of burst durations. Although both adaptive and conventional deep brain stimulation suppressed mean beta activity amplitude compared to the unstimulated state, this was achieved by a selective effect on burst duration during adaptive deep brain stimulation, whereas conventional deep brain stimulation globally suppressed beta activity. We posit that the relatively selective effect of adaptive deep brain stimulation provides a rationale for why this approach could be more efficacious than conventional continuous deep brain stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and helps inform how adaptive deep brain stimulation might best be delivered."

Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common form of dementia is manifested with Lewy body formation and dopaminergic dysfunction. Present study explores silymarin, a known hepatoprotective regimen for its efficacy in Aging and PD using Caenorhabditis elegans. Silymarin positively modulated longevity, reduced oxidative stress, independent of feeding behaviour. Up-regulation of longevity and stress related genes daf-16, sod-3, gst-4 and skn-1 indicate the possible involvement of these genes for regulating longevity. In-addition silymarin alleviated PD symptoms by reducing alpha-synuclein levels, lipid accumulation and enhanced dopamine function. Silymarin executes its beneficial effects through mitigation of free radicals, while achieving alleviation in Parkinsonism possibly through pdr-1 mediated recruitment of ubiquitin proteasome system as evident from qPCR studies. Altogether, silymarin emerged as a potent molecule for investigation in Aging and age related disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Materials 11 right-handed healthy volunteers (six male and five female, age range 27-64 years) were studied with fNIRS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing MTA task for each hand. Results MTA performance was better for the dominant hand and younger participants. Both fNIRS and fMRI analyses revealed MTA-related increase of haemoglobin levels in the primary motor and premotor cortices contralateral to the moving hand. This response progressively increased with aging. Conclusion These findings supported the translation of fNIRS-based MTA behavioural tool in clinical practice."

MethodsTwenty-two patients with iRBD, 21 patients with MSA, 22 patients with PD, and 21 normal controls were included in this study. All participants underwent one night of video-polysomnography monitoring, and the sleep parameters were analyzed using Polysmith software and by visual analysis. TCS was performed following a standardized procedure. The echogenicity of the substantia nigra and basal ganglia were evaluated. ResultsA greater proportion of PD patients were found to have substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (86.4%) when compared to iRBD patients (31.8%), MSA patients (23.8%), and normal controls (4.8%) (P < 0.001). Fourteen MSA patients (66.7%) and 11 iRBD patients (50.0%) had hyperechogenicity in the basal ganglia, whereas hyperechogenicity in the basal ganglia was less frequent in PD patients (18.2%) and normal controls (9.5%) (P < 0.001). Poor sleep efficiency, less stage II sleep time, and more periodic leg movements were found in MSA and PD patients, whereas iRBD patients had almost normal sleep. ConclusionSome iRBD patients had basal ganglia hyperechogenicity that was similar to that observed in MSA, which may represent another possible convert direction. The present study further confirmed iRBD as a prodromal stage of synucleinopathy. TCS could detect subclinical changes and thus might provide useful markers for identifying individuals at increased risk for developing a synucleinopathy."

We investigated the origins and changes in meaning of these terms over time, particularly in relation to Parkinson's disease (PD). We searched the literature from 1817 to 2015 for use and interpretation of the words akinesia, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and PD. We found that akinesia and hypokinesia appeared as terms in the 19th century, opposite to hyperkinesia, but were used in the context of PD since 1920, while at the same time the 'bradykinetic syndrome' was introduced. Use of all terms increased in this period due to the encephalitis-lethargica-epidemic, and increased again with the discovery of levodopa from 1961. With the extensive use of criteria sets from the 1980s, bradykinesia replaced akinesia as the most commonly used term. The advent of the internet led to an increase in publications and an associated increase in heterogeneity in the use of the terms. This review shows the variation over time and the lack of unity in the terminology used to describe the range of movement execution disturbances. The current terminology fails to capture the nuances of the challenges we face in documenting these disturbances. We therefore recommend that the current situation may benefit from an objective and computationally solid approach using insights from network and circuitry technology and new developments in assessment technology. It is expected that this will contribute to a new framework for terminology in movement disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The some specific conditions which were concealed beyond the cardiovascular pathophysiology except well-known risk factors for ACS and stent thrombosis might involve the onset of ACS. We describe a case of a 64-year-old man who was admitted to intensive care unit for chest pain. This case found the possibility that polycythemia vera with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation might be a underlying disease of ACS with stent thrombosis, and highlighted the importance of recognizing polycythemia vera with JAK2 V617F mutation as concealed disease for cardiologists.

So far, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the ATL are not well understood. Therefore, in this study it was hypothesized that JAK2 (V617F) mutation may be present in samples from patients with ATL. This case control study was performed in north-eastern Iran. Using polymerase chain reaction, JAK2 (V617F) mutation was performed in 20 DNA samples from ATL patients and 20 HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (control group). The results of ATL subjects and the control group were compared by using SPSS software. In the case group 13 (65 %) and 7 patients (35 %) were male and female respectively, with the age range between 40 and 80 years. Only one patients has JAK2 mutation and this mutation was absent in 95 % of ATL patients as well as the HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers. The results of our study demonstrated that JAK2 V617F mutation is not a common phenomenon in ATL. However, further studies are required to investigate the possible dysregulation of JAK signaling in ATL."

To evaluate the efficiency of interferon (IFN) therapy in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Subjects and methods. A total of 61 patients (41 with ET and 20 with PV) were examined. Prior to study enrolment, 44 (72%) patients with ET or PV received one or other therapy (aspirin was not taken into account). The mean Jak2V617F mutant allele at baseline was 23% (6-54%) in the patients with ET and 40% (11-88%) in those with PV. The median time from diagnosis to enrollment was 49 months. Results. The paper presents the clinical and molecular findings of long-term INF-alpha therapy in patients with ET or PV. The median follow-up was 52 months. Recombinant IFN-alpha(2) showed its ability to induce complete hematologic remission (ET (76%), PV (70%)) and a complete molecular response. 22 (69%) out of 32 patients were noted to have a smaller number of cells with the Jak2V617F mutation. In the patients with PV and in those with ET, the relative reduction in the proportion of cells with the Jak2V617F mutant gene averaged 85% and 56% of the baseline values, respectively. There was a reduction in the proportion of cells expressing the Jak2V617F mutation in, both the ET (from 12 to 2.2%; p=0.001) and PV (from 32.7% to 3.2%) groups (p=0.001). Ten (31%) patients achieved a deep molecular remission (<= 2% Jak2V617F allele); among them, 5 patients were not found to have Jak2V617F mutation. The obtained molecular response remained in 7 of the 10 patients untreated for 11 to 86 months. The long-term treatment with IFN-alpha led to normalization of the morphological pattern of bone marrow in 5 of the 7 PV or ET patients. Conclusion. Significant molecular remissions achieved by therapy with recombinant interferon -alpha(2) confirm the appropriateness of this treatment option in in the majority of patients with ET or PV."

To identify the clinical features of latent polycythemia vera (PV) as an independent nosological entity. Subjects and methods. The investigation enrolled 81 patients (50 with extensive (manifest) PV and 31 with latent PV) who had visited the Outpatient Department, Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, in 2014 to October 2015. Results. The gender distribution of the patients was statistically comparable in the analyzed groups. The patients with manifest PV were slightly older than those with latent PV: the median age in the compared groups was 56 and 44 years, respectively. Red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentrations, and packed cell volume were higher in the patients with manifest PV. Blood platelet counts were higher in the latent PV group. There were no differences in the number of white blood cells in the compared groups. All the patients were JAK2 V617F mutation carriers. The JAK2 allele load was significantly higher in the manifest PV group than in the latent PV group. The compared patient groups differed in the rate of thromboses in the history or at diagnosis. In the patients with latent PV, thromboses were detected in 38% of cases versus 16% in those with manifest PV. In latent PV, there were mainly venous thromboses; abdominal vascular thromboses were diagnosed with a high frequency. Arterial thromboses were revealed in only 2 cases. Conclusion. Chronic myeloproliferative disease that is characterized by the JAK2 V617F mutation, borderline hemoglobin counts, and morphological features of a bone marrow trephine biopsy specimen, which are specific for PV, is an independent PV variant, namely: latent PV."

Moreover, mutations in the additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1) gene were recently shown in various myeloid malignancies. There were no previous studies investigating the incidence of the ASXL1 and JAK2V617F mutations in Iranian patients with CML. Consequently, this study focuses on the analysis of these mutations in patients with CML. Methods: In total, 66 patients with a clinical diagnosis of CML were examined at the time of diagnosis. Thirty healthy subjects were checked as controls. Exon 12 of ASXL1 was amplified from genomic DNA and bidirectionally sequenced. We also performed JAK2V617F screening by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Results: Mutations in the ASXL1 gene were found in five out of 66 CML patients (7.6%). We identified a novel variant (c.1968G >A, p.Asp656Asn) in one of the patients that has not been reported before. We also identified BCR-ABL and JAK2V617F mutations simultaneously in four patients (6%). Conclusion: Our demonstration of ASXL1 mutation, a putative tumor suppressor gene, represents an important molecular abnormality in CML. We also showed that concomitant detection of BCR-ABL and JAK2V617F mutations has a relatively high incidence in Iranian patients."

ResultsThe geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of GP2015/ETN for C-max (1.11 [1.05-1.17]), AUC(0-tlast) (0.98 [0.94-1.02]) and AUC(0-inf) (0.96 [0.93-1.00]) were within the predefined bioequivalence range of 0.80-1.25. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of AI/PFS for C-max (1.01 [0.94-1.08]), AUC(0-tlast) (1.01 [0.95-1.07]) and AUC(0-inf) (1.01 [0.96-1.07]) were also within the range 0.80-1.25. No new safety issues were reported. Three subjects had low titres of non-neutralising anti-drug antibodies during a follow-up visit in the bioequivalence study. ConclusionsThe PK of GP2015 was similar to ETN, demonstrating bioequivalence. The safety profile of GP2015 was consistent with previous reports for ETN. The GP2015 AI provided equivalent dosing and tolerability to the GP2015 PFS."
3047,Medical , Psoriasis  , dose escalation; efficacy and safety; infliximab; Japanese; psoriasis        ,"Although infliximab is approved for psoriasis, its efficacy is reduced over time in some patients. The aim of this phase III trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of infliximab dose escalation in Japanese psoriasis patients with loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy. Patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, pustular psoriasis or psoriatic erythroderma who showed loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy received infliximab dose escalation (10 mg/kg every 8 weeks) from weeks 0 to 32. Loss of efficacy was defined as not maintaining 50% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) after achieving PASI 75. Efficacy and safety were evaluated up to week 40. Fifty-one patients received dose escalation and 43 completed the study. PASI 75 and median improvement rate of PASI score at week 40 were 44% and 70.0%, respectively, showing efficacy in skin symptoms. Efficacies in quality of life, nail psoriasis and joint pain were also obtained. Median serum infliximab level increased from less than 0.1 to 1.1 g/mL from weeks 0 to 40, showing positive correlation between efficacy and serum infliximab level at week 40. Favorable efficacy was observed in patients with detectable serum infliximab levels (0.1 g/mL) at baseline. Incidences of adverse events, serious adverse events, serious infections and serious infusion reactions were 92%, 10%, 4% and 0%, respectively. No marked difference was observed in both efficacy and safety among psoriasis types. No new safety concerns were observed. Infliximab dose escalation was effective and well-tolerated in psoriasis patients with loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy, suggesting that dose escalation may be a useful therapeutic option for these patients."

Few studies have evaluated the dermoscopic features of psoriatic nails. The aim of this study was to clarify the dermoscopic features of nail psoriasis and identify those that reflect psoriatic activity. During biologic treatment of psoriasis, six patients with psoriatic nails twice underwent dermoscopic examination, with an interval of 17-42 weeks. We used the modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index score and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score to identify and assess dermoscopic features. We identified 10 dermoscopic findings, of which disappearance of diffuse scaling of the nail plate, transverse step-like notches and splinter hemorrhages of the nail bed, and appearance of erythematous borders of the onycholytic area were associated with improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score. Dermoscopy can detect nail changes during psoriasis treatment and should be used to evaluate treatment success."

This study investigated the levels of signal peptide-CUB-EGF (epidermal growth factor-like protein) family domain-containing protein (SCUBE) 1 and 3. Potential value as a novel marker of angiogenesis in patients with psoriasis is also evaluated by assessing possible relation of SCUBE-1 and 3 with disease activity in conjunction with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, as an established marker of angiogenesis. Forty-eight patients with psoriasis (aged >18 years) and 48 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. Detailed information was obtained through history and physical examination. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores were calculated. Blood SCUBE 1 and 3, and VEGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean PASI score of the patients was 6.7 +/- 4.1. Patients' serum SCUBE 1 and 3 and VEGF levels were significantly higher than those of the controls (P = 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 83 and 62% for the 0.67 ng/ml cut-off level of SCUBE 1, and 63 and 71% for the 2.57 ng/ml cut-off level of SCUBE 3, respectively. A cut-off VEGF level of 310 ng/mL predicted the presence of psoriasis with a sensitivity of 50% and specificity of 77%. The results of this pioneering study indicate that SCUBE protein family appears to have a probable role in the pathogenesis and angiogenesis development in psoriasis and SCUBE 1 and 3 may be novel markers of angiogenesis in psoriasis."

In the pathogenesis of AIDs, the role of the genetic background is triggered by environmental factors through the modulation of the innate immune system. Monogenic AIDs are characterized by Mendelian inheritance and are caused by highly penetrant genetic variants in single genes. During the last years, remarkable progress has been made in the identification of disease-associated genes by using new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, which has allowed the genetic characterization in undiagnosed patients and in sporadic cases by means of targeted resequencing of a gene panel and whole exome sequencing. In this review, we delineate the genetics of the monogenic AIDs, report the role of the most common gene mutations, and describe the evidences of the most sound genotype/phenotype correlations in AID."

A cross-sectional study of 53 patients with PsA and 53 controls matched for age and sex was designed. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and the presence of carotid plaques (CP) were assessed with carotid ultrasound. Data on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors were collected. Patients with PsA had a higher prevalence rate of obesity and tobacco smoking. CP were detected more frequently in patients with PsA than in controls with an OR of 4.15, 95% CI 1.4-12.1, which adjusted for smoking and those with history of CV disease gave an OR of 3.9, 95% CI 1.2-12.7, p = 0.026. Carotid IMT was significantly higher in patients with PsA adjusted for age and tobacco smoking. According to ultrasound data, 30.2% of patients with PsA had carotid atherosclerosis (presence of CP and/or carotid IMT >0.90 mm) compared with 9.4% of controls. The SCORE index (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation) underestimated the CV risk in these patients: most patients with CP had an intermediate CV risk. According to carotid ultrasound data, PsA patients have a high prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis. These results support the importance of screening for CV risk and to include carotid ultrasound in CV prevention strategies in these patients."

The ability of AP to form solvates has been investigated and three solvatomorphs of AP, namely, the AP ethyl acetate hemisolvate, C22H24N2O7S center dot 0.5C(4)H(8)O(2), the AP toluene hemisolvate, C22H24N2-O7S center dot 0.5C(7)H(8), and the AP dichloromethane monosolvate, C22H24N2O7S center dot CH2Cl2, were obtained. The three AP solvatomorphs were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was used to analyze the structures, crystal symmetry, packing modes, stoichiometry and hydrogen-bonding interactions of the solvatomorphs. In addition, dissolution analyses were performed to study the dissolution rates of different AP solvatomorph tablets in vitro and to make comparisons with commercial apremilast tablets (produced by Celgene); all three solvatomorphs showed similar dissolution rates and similar values of the similarity factor f(2) in a comparison of their dissolution profiles."

However, the detailed mechanism of FOXP3 has not been well defined. Increasing evidence indicates that FOXP3 involves epigenetic mechanisms to fulfill its functions. We anticipated several types of mechanisms that might link FOXP3 to the epigenetic profile, and assessed the impact of FOXP3 on the global profile of histone H3 acetylation and methylation. We found that overexpression of FOXP3 increased histone H3-lysine9 demethylation (H3K9me2), H3K79me2, H3-lysine9 acetylation (H3K9ac), and H3K18ac. When cells were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, FOXP3 clearly increased the levels of H3K9ac and H3K18ac. Hypoxia increased H3 modifications, whereas the overexpression of FOXP3 during hypoxia stabilized H3K9me2, H3K79me2, H3K9ac, and H3K18ac levels almost back to normal. FOXP3 functions opposite to TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) in H3 modifications. The modifications altered by FOXP3 may influence the cell cycle and apoptosis; we showed that FOXP3 increased the proportion of cells in S phase, decreased the proportion of cells in G2/M phase, and markedly enhanced cell apoptosis. In conclusion, this work provides evidence that FOXP3 is an epigenetic regulator, and implies a new molecular basis for the pathogenesis in some diseases."

Accumulating studies have shown that epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in nociceptive process in the spinal dorsal horn. In this present study, we investigated the role of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2), a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, in the spinal dorsal horn in the genesis of neuropathic pain in rats induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase, which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 on K27 (H3K27), resulting in gene silencing. We found that levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27TM) in the spinal dorsal horn were increased in rats with neuropathic pain on day 3 and day 10 post nerve injuries. EZH2 was predominantly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn under normal conditions. The number of neurons with EZH2 expression was increased after nerve injury. More strikingly, nerve injury drastically increased the number of microglia with EZH2 expression by more than sevenfold. Intrathecal injection of the EZH2 inhibitor attenuated the development and maintenance of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in rats with nerve injury. Such analgesic effects were concurrently associated with the reduced levels of EZH2, H3K27TM, lba1, GFAP, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and MCP-1 in the spinal dorsal horn in rats with nerve injury. Our results highly suggest that targeting the EZH2 signaling pathway could be an effective approach for the management of neuropathic pain. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The pathophysiology of ACI is multifactorial, resulting from the effects of inflammatory cytokines which both directly and indirectly suppress erythropoiesis. Recent advances in molecular understanding of iron metabolism provide strong evidence that immune mediators, such as IL-6, lead to hepcidin-induced hypoferremia, iron sequestration, and decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. The role of hepcidin-ferroportin axis in the pathophysiology of ACI is stimulating the development of new diagnostics and targeted therapies. In this review, we present an overview of and rationale for inflammation-, iron-, and erythropoiesis-related strategies currently in development."
3867,Medical , Rheumatoid Arthritis  , Fc-gamma receptor type I; IgG immune complex; Dorsal root ganglion; Pain Nociceptive neuron        ,"Antigen-specific immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are often accompanied by pain and hyperalgesia. Our previous studies have demonstrated that Fc-gamma-receptor type I (FcyRI) is expressed in a subpopulation of rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and can be directly activated by IgG immune complex (IgG-IC). In this study we investigated whether neuronal FcyRI contributes to antigen-specific pain in the naive and rheumatoid arthritis model rats. In vitro calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamp recordings in dissociated DRG neurons revealed that only the small-, but not medium-or large-sized DRG neurons responded to IgG-IC. Accordingly, in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that intradermal injection of IgG-IC into the peripheral receptive field could sensitize only the C-(but not A-) type sensory neurons and evoke action potential discharges. Pain-related behavioral tests showed that intradermal injection of IgG-IC dose-dependently produced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the hindpaw of rats. These behavioral effects could be alleviated by localized administration of non-specific IgG or an FcyRI antibody, but not by mast cell stabilizer or histamine antagonist. In a rat model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) produced by methylated bovine serum albumin, FcyRI were found upregulated exclusively in the small-sized DRG neurons. In vitro calcium imaging revealed that significantly more small-sized DRG neurons responded to IgG-IC in the AIA rats, although there was no significant difference between the AIA and control rats in the magnitude of calcium changes in the DRG neurons. Moreover, in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that C-nociceptive neurons in the AIA rats exhibited a greater incidence of action potential discharges and stronger responses to mechanical stimuli after IgG-IC was injected to the receptive fields. These results suggest that FcyRI expressed in the peripheral nociceptors might be directly activated by IgG-IC and contribute to antigen-specific pain in pathological conditions.

4498,Medical , Rheumatoid Arthritis  , Auranofin; Zebrafish; Developmental toxicity; Cardiac toxicity; Hypopigmentation        ,"Auranofin (AF) is used in clinic for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, repurposing of AF as an anticancer drug has just finished a phase I/II clinical trial, but the developmental toxicity of AF remains obscure. This study focused on its developmental toxicity by using zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations (1, 2.5, 5, 10m) of AF from 2h post-fertilization (hpf) to 72 hpf. At 72 hpf, two major developmental defects caused by AF were found, namely severe pericardial edema and hypopigmentation, when embryos were exposed to concentrations higher than 2.5m. Biochemical detection of oxidative stress enzyme combined with expressions of a series of genes related to oxidative stress, cardiac, metal stress and pigment formation were subsequently tested. The superoxide dismutase activity was decreased while malondialdehyde content was accumulated by AF treatment. The expression of oxidative stress-related genes (sod1, gpx1a, gst), pigment-related genes (mitfb, trp-1a) and one metal stress-related gene ctr1 were all decreased by AF exposure. The expressions of cardiac-related genes (amhc, vmhc) and one metal-related gene hsp70 were found to be significantly upregulated by AF exposure. These findings indicated the potential developmental toxicity of AF on zebrafish early development. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

CAR is a degenerative disease of the retina characterized by sudden vision loss in patients with cancer and serum anti-retinal AAbs. In this review, we discuss the widespread serum presence of anti-glycolytic enzyme AAbs and their significance in autoimmune diseases. There are multiple mechanisms responsible for antibody generation, including the innate anti-microbial response, anti-tumor response, or autoimmune response against released self-antigens from damaged, inflamed tissue. AAbs against enolase, GADPH, and aldolase exist in a single patient in elevated titers, suggesting their participation in pathogenicity. The lack of restriction of AAbs to one disease may be related to an increased expression of glycolytic enzymes in various metabolically active tissues that triggers an autoimmune response and generation of AAbs with the same specificity in several chronic and autoimmune conditions. In CAR, the importance of serum anti-glycolytic enzyme AAbs had been previously dismissed, but the retina may be without pathological consequence until a failure of the blood-retinal barrier function, which would then allow pathogenic AAbs access to their retinal targets, ultimately leading to damaging effects."

To examine the perspectives of health professionals of different disciplines about clinical handover. Background. Ineffective handovers can cause major problems relating to the lack of delivery of appropriate care. Design. A prospective, cross-sectional design was conducted using a survey about clinical handover practices. Methods. Health professionals employed in public metropolitan hospitals, public rural hospitals and community health centres were involved. The sample comprised doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, including physiotherapists, social workers, pharmacists, dieticians and midwives employed in Western Australia, New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. The survey sought information about health professionals' experiences about clinical handover; their perceived effectiveness of clinical handover; involvement of patients and family members; health professionals' ability to confirm understanding and to clarify clinical information; role modelling behaviour of health professionals; training needs; adverse events encountered and possibilities for improvements. Results. In all, 707 health professionals participated (response rate = 14%). Represented professions were nursing (60%), medicine (22%) and allied health (18%). Many health professionals reported being aware of adverse events where they noticed poor handover was a significant cause. Differences existed between health professions in terms of how effectively they gave handover, perceived effectiveness of bedside handover vs. nonbedside handover, patient and family involvement in handover, respondents' confirmation of understanding handover from their perspective, their observation of senior health professionals giving feedback to junior health professionals, awareness of adverse events and severity of adverse events relating to poor handovers. Conclusions. Complex barriers impeded the conduct of effective handovers, including insufficient opportunities for training, lack of role modelling, and lack of confidence and understanding about handover processes."

This study investigated community dwelling adults' definition of trust in health care providers vs. interpersonal trust, description of the attributes of a trustworthy provider, factors that influenced the development and loss of trust. Background. Trust is an important part of health care relationships, however, the meaning of trust for patients is not well understood. Health care providers need to understand the meaning of trust in order to build and maintain therapeutic relationships with their patients. Design. A descriptive qualitative research design was used to investigate perceptions of trust. Methods. Semi-structured open-ended interviews were carried out with 32 community dwelling adults. The participants were recruited from church groups, senior health programs and other community programs. The interviews were thematically analysed for: definitions of interpersonal trust vs. trust in a health care provider, attributes of a trustworthy provider and factors that were pivotal in the development and loss of trust in a health care provider. Results. Trust in health care providers differed from interpersonal trust in the role-specific attributes of the individuals. Trust, although influenced by having confidence in the provider's competence, was strongly tied to the interpersonal caring attributes of the provider. Loss of trust, on the other hand, was more closely allied with the issues of competency. Conclusions. Perceptions of trust varied greatly among this sample, reinforcing the significance of tailoring our approach to patients on an individual basis. Relevance to clinical practice. Assuming that we will be trusted based on our role as nurses may not facilitate the development of a therapeutic relationship with some patients. Nurses and other health care providers need to be acutely aware of our patient's trust and clues of pending loss of trust because, as this study and other prior studies have shown, once trust in a provider is lost, it is nearly impossible to rebuild."
3370,Medical , Senior Health  , National Council on Radiation Protection; medical imaging; radiation; ionizing; computed tomography        ,"Among the many diagnostic and therapeutic uses of ionizing radiation in medicine, the potential for misuse is greatest in diagnostic imaging, particularly with computed tomography. While several technical adjustments may be made to produce a dose that is as low as reasonably achievable, appropriate utilization of these tests is a more difficult issue to address. The risks of ionizing radiation, taking into account the patient's age, sex, and body part to be examined, must be balanced with the potential benefit that comes with medical imaging. Fortunately, the benefits outweigh the risks in most clinical scenarios, particularly in patients without a confirmed diagnosis. However, the repetitive imaging of patients with known clinical conditions to assess for interval change may pose the greatest opportunity to curb over-utilization of imaging tests that may be harmful. The medical community at large must be educated in the effects of ionizing radiation. Moreover, practitioners must be inspired to differentiate imaging tests for primary diagnosis from those performed in follow-up of known pathology in common diagnostic algorithms. This metamorphosis must extend from the most senior health care administrator to the most junior healthcare professional and must include those who are charged with acquiring the necessary imaging tests. In addition, imaging professionals must avail themselves of the numerous technical advances that allow a reduction in the dose of ionizing radiation that is associated with common imaging procedures. And, dose monitoring must be performed on many levels, including the dose to an individual patient undergoing a specific imaging test."

To determine the effect of this care model approach in a nonprofit healthcare system, an observational, longitudinal panel study of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries was performed to examine the effect on physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Participants in the study were recruited from a community sample of 6,864 eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Informed consent and baseline data were obtained from 1,709 individuals (recruitment response rate=25%) and complete data across 30 months from 1,307 (completion response rate=76%). Participants receiving care in the CCM-based senior healthcare practice (n=318) were compared with patients of primary care physicians supported by care managers (n=598) and a group without care managers (n=391). Self-reported data were collected over the telephone to measure physical function and HRQL at baseline and 6, 18, and 30 months. A multiple group mixture growth model was used to analyze physical function and HRQL across the 30 months. Physical function and HRQL mean scores decreased across time in all participants and were moderately correlated at each wave (correlation coefficient=0.74-0.79). Two latent growth classes were identified. In class 1, physical function decreased, and HRQL remained stable across time. In class 2, physical function and HRQL decreased in parallel. Ninety-seven percent of intervention group patients were in class 1, and 99% of patients in comparison groups 1 and 2 were in class 2. Despite physical function decline, patients in a senior health clinic care model maintained HRQL over time, whereas patients receiving traditional care had physical function and HRQL decline. An interdisciplinary team CCM approach appears to have a positive effect on HRQL in this population."

Methods: Patients were randomised to H-CR or SC-CR after admission for acute coronary syndrome. In SC-CR, the general practitioner took over the responsibility of the remaining rehabilitation, pharmacological treatment and risk factor management after the initial visit to the hospital outpatient clinic. The Municipal Health Care Centres provided courses on smoking cessation, nutrition, and exercise training and contributed to disease education and psychosocial support. The main endpoint was adherence to the CR programme and compliance with lifestyle modifications. Results: In total, 1364 patients were screened, 327 (24%) were eligible, and 212 (65%) accepted participation. Phase II CR was completed by 192 (91%) of the participants. Full adherence to the CR programme was seen in 53% in SC-CR versus 54% in H-CR (relative risk (RR): 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.73-1.32). In H-CR, patients had higher rates of adherence to dietary advice and health education. In SC-CR, 12% of patients did not attend the risk factor evaluation and clinical assessment with their general practitioner. No difference in risk factor improvement was found. Exercise training was declined by 25% in both groups. Conclusion: Adherence to phase II CR was high in both groups. SC-CR did not improve adherence and efficacy, but had comparable effects on medication and risk factors. Thus, SC-CR was safe and effective."

This paper aims at assessing the effectiveness of incentives. Methods The evidence is based on an overview of reviews. The methodological approach involved a systematic literature search in 8 databases and a quality assessment of the systematic reviews. Results 17 systematic reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Incentives have positive effects on smoking cessation ( particularly for pregnant women and women post partum), effects decreased once incentives were suspended, though. There is no evidence that incentives have a preventive effect on children and adolescents. Conclusions Effective smoking restriction necessitates concerted actions combining incentives for individuals and preventive measures on the policy-level."

Design Secondary data analysis of participants (n = 1504) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multi-site smoking cessation trial who provided ecological momentary assessments of withdrawal symptoms on their quit day. Participants received smoking cessation counseling and were randomized to receive placebo or one of five active pharmacotherapies. Setting Research offices in Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Participants Adult smokers (n = 1236; 58% female, 86% white), recruited from the community via advertisements, who abstained on their quit day. Measurements Demographics and tobacco dependence were assessed at baseline and participants carried palmtop computers to record withdrawal symptoms (craving, negative affect, difficulty concentrating, hunger and anhedonia) on their quit day. Point-prevalence abstinence and latency to relapse were assessed at 8 weeks and 6 months post-quit. Findings Latent class analysis identified four withdrawal classes [Akaike information criterion (AIC) = 70.09]: Moderate withdrawal (64% of sample), high craving-anhedonia (8% of sample), affective withdrawal (13% of sample) and hunger (15% of sample). The high craving-anhedonia class reported significantly higher dependence (P < 0.01), were less likely to have received combination nicotine replacement, reported lower week 8 abstinence rates and relapsed sooner than those in the moderate withdrawal class (P < 0.05). The affective withdrawal class reported higher levels of baseline negative affect and life-time psychopathology (P < 0.05) and relapsed more quickly than the moderate withdrawal class (P < 0.01). Conclusions While the majority of smokers report typical levels of withdrawal symptoms on their quit day, more than one-third report extreme craving or extreme negative affective or extreme hunger responses to initial abstinence. These distinct quit-day withdrawal symptom patterns are related to baseline characteristics, treatment and cessation success."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of varenicline in smokers with diabetes who participated in 15 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. Materials and Methods: This retrospective pooled analysis included data from smokers of >= 10 cigarettes per day with diabetes. Participants received varenicline 1 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. We examined carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rates (CARs) for weeks 9-12, 9-24 and 9-52, and compared safety in participants with and without diabetes. Results: Of 6,771 participants, 323 had diabetes (varenicline n = 162; placebo n = 161). Week 9-12 CAR was higher with varenicline than placebo (43.8% vs 24.8%; odds ratio 2.36, 95% CI 1.47-3.79), as was week 9-24 CAR (27.5% vs 14.4%; odds ratio 2.25, 95% CI 1.27-4.00). Week 9-52 CAR was 18.4% for varenicline and 10.1% for placebo (odds ratio 2.00, 95% CI 0.90-4.49). The most commonly-reported adverse events in participants with diabetes for varenicline vs placebo were: nausea (27.2% vs 8.1%); headache (9.3% vs 9.9%); and insomnia (8.6% vs 5.6%), incidences that were similar in participants without diabetes (29.6% vs 9.7%; 13.4% vs 10.9%; and 11.4% vs 7.1%, respectively). Weight gain in quitters with diabetes (1.7 kg) was similar to that of those without diabetes (2.1 kg). Conclusions: Varenicline was an effective and well-tolerated aid for smoking cessation in individuals with diabetes. Safety was comparable with participants without diabetes."
2635,Medical , Smoking Cessation  , Varenicline; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Cardiovascular diseases; Type-2 diabetes mellitus; Smoking cessation; Budgetary impact; Spanish National Health System        ,"Aims: The study aimed to assess the budgetary impact (BI) of reimbursing varenicline in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type-2 diabetes mellitus (t2DM) or cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Methods: The BI was estimated comparing the current non-reimbursed scenario versus a projected reimbursed scenario using the Spanish National Health System (SNHS) perspective. A hybrid model was developed using epidemiological data and Markov chains to estimate smoking cessation rates with varenicline during a 5-year horizon. Costs of cessation were considered in the reimbursement scenario only. Efficacy, expressed as a 1-year continuous abstinence rate, was derived from clinical trials. Cost savings due to smoking cessation were extracted from local cost-of-illness studies. Results are shown as incremental cost savings. Univariate sensitivity analysis was also applied. Results: A total of 68,684 patients stopped smoking in the reimbursed scenario compared with 15,208 without reimbursement. In the reimbursed scenario, total savings accounted for (sic) 36.3 million, showing 14.6 million accumulated additional savings compared with the scenario without reimbursement. Sensitivity analyses showed results to be robust with monetary savings starting in the third year of modeling. Conclusion: Reimbursement of varenicline in smoking cessation is a cost-effective health policy in the SNHS in COPD, t2-DM or CVD, and could produce cost savings starting in the third year of implementation.

The aim of this study is to increase the biocompatibility of a metallic material by deposition of a ceramic material on his surface. The metallic material, known as titanium Grade 5 (Ti6Al4V), was investigated through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, with a SE detector for 2 and 3D images) and an Energy Dispersive X-ray Analyser (EDAX), after chemical attack and after HA deposition. Hydroxyapatite was deposited using electrophoretic equipment, each time using the same experimental conditions, so that a comparison can be made. After deposition, the material was calcined and some mechanical properties were investigated. The experimental results present a homogeneous layer formed with a very good adhesion and dimensionally reduced particles. The metallic material, used as dental implant, presents a better corrosion resistance in simulated body fluid electrolyte and the EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) tests emphasize the formation of two layers, a compact one of TiO2 (titanium oxide) and a porous one of HA on top of the surface."

In Sweden, 80% of the sports federations have their mandatory injury insurance for all athletes in the same insurance company and injury data are systematically kept in a national database. The aim of the study was to identify high-risk sports with respect to incidence of acute and severe injuries in 35 sports reported to the database. The number and incidences of injuries as well as injuries leading to permanent medical impairment (PMI) were calculated during 2008-2011. Each year approximately 12000 injuries and 1162660 licensed athletes were eligible for analysis. Eighty-five percent of the injuries were reported in football, ice hockey, floorball, and handball. The highest injury incidence as well as PMI was in motorcycle, handball, skating, and ice hockey. Females had higher risk of a PMI compared with males in automobile sport, handball, floorball, and football. High-risk sports with numerous injuries and high incidence of PMI injuries were motorcycle, handball, ice hockey, football, floorball, and automobile sports. Thus, these sports ought to be the target of preventive actions at national level."
2290,Medical , Sports Injuries  , Athletic injuries; Volleyball; Body Mass Index; Wounds and injuries        ,"Aim. Although physical activity brings a range of lifelong health benefits, it may also lead to injuries that pose a significant threat to health. It is particularly noticeable in people involved in professional sports where sport-related injuries commonly occur and are associated with intense exercise which aims to improve physical fitness. The article attempts to determine incidence of sports injuries reported by Plus League volleyball players, as well as to identify their most common types and causes. Methods. The research project involved 90 Plus League volleyball players aged 18-37 with the average age of 25.11 (SD +/- 5.378). A method of diagnostic survey was applied to collect empirical data by means of questionnaire developed by the authors (researchers). The results were statistically analysed and verified with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi(2) test at the significance level (or critical P-value) of P <= 0.05 Results. Over 87% of the respondents suffered from at least one sport-related injury. In total, 362 injuries occurred, on average 4.02 injuries per one volleyball player. The most common sports injuries involved ankle or talocrural joint (46 injuries), knee and lower leg muscles (30), interphalangeal articulations of fingers (30) as well as shoulder joint. More than half of the injuries (57%) occurred twice or three times. Volleyball players commonly sustain injuries through contact with an opposing player in competition. Sport-specific injuries may also occur due to exhaustion, lack of rest and undertreated injuries. Conclusion. The most common volleyball-related injuries are primarily talocrural joint, hand and shoulder injuries. Common types of injuries that can affect volleyball players include muscles, joints and ligaments injuries, sprains and strains as well as bruises. Most of these injuries are caused by exhaustion, contact with an opposing player during competition and fatigue. The incidence of sport-related injuries seems to be influenced by such factors as somatic features, jumping parameters and the length of professional volleyball career."
2297,Medical , Sports Injuries  , Taekwondo; Training; Stress    physiological       ,"Aim. The previous studies reported of an outstanding amount of injuries during taekwondo competitions in which, the dominant mechanism results in the physical contact between the athletes. Therefore, a training program was designed considering physiological stress during a competition, in which the athlete would perform with a pad instead of a real opponent in order to prevent injury during preparatory competition. Methods. Twelve elite taekwondo players were selected (ages: 22 +/- 3 years, height: 178.66 +/- 6.58 cm, weight: 69.75 +/- 14.51 kg). VO2 (max) was measured using Bruce's exhaustive test (46.22 +/- 4.61 mL/min/kg). Then the anaerobic power was measured using RAST field method (9.8 +/- 1.08 W/kg). Heart rate (HR) alterations were determined using RPE10 Borog Scale before the competition, at three intervals periods between any round and at the end of the third round. Blood lactate concentration (LA) was evaluated before and after the competition. To evaluate the ratio of fighting to non-fighting activity, a digital video camera was used. During the simulation, taekwondo players performed motor skills simulating a competition with the pads. Change of blood lactate, HR and RPE were measured and compared with competition conditions (the opponents). Data were compared by one-way repeated-measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results. No significant differences were observed between the two conditions of competition and simulation training in HR, LA and RPE variables (P>0.05). Conclusion. Apparently the simulation training inflicts physiological stress on the elite athletes that may be replaced for preparatory competitions before a tournament to avoid possible sports injuries."
1212,Medical , Sprains and Strains  , SCOTCHRAP; BANDAGES; LIGAMENTS    ANKLE; SPRAINS AND STRAINS       ,"A randomized, controlled, parallel-group study was perform to compare the clinical efficacy of a semi-rigid bandage ('Scotchrap') with the standard adhesive tape treatment for ankle ligament injuries. The semi-rigid bandage support wrap consists of a knitted fibreglass fabric impregnated with a polyurethane resin. The cotton stockinet and the synthetic cast padding are used for protection of pressure points and any bony prominences. Prior to application, the 'Scotchrap' must be soaked in water after which it is applied in a way similar to that used for a plaster of paris bandage. The finished bandage remains elastic, allowing normal dorsal and plantar flexion of the foot, but preventing inversion and eversion, and pronation and supination. A t rest, the bandage always redresses the immobilized ankle into the neutral position, One hundred and thirty-six patients were included in the study. The semi-rigid bandage group comprised 59 patients and the tape group had 57 patients. These two groups were statistically comparable. The intake questionnaire included a general and a specific anamnesis form as well as a physical examination form. Follow-up data were recorded every 2 weeks. After termination of the treatment, the patients evaluated treatment efficacy. Statistical analysis of 126 items per patient with chi2-tests (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) and Fisher's exact tests (p less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) revealed no statistical significant differences in treatment result. The patient assessments of treatment efficacy of both types of bandage were also comparable. Both types of bandage gave sufficient stability (98%; p<0.005) and were equally effective. This study has shown that 'Scotchrap' can be used for lateral ankle ligament lesions with excellent short-term results. The technique for application of the 'Scotchrap' bandage is easy to learn, but must be considered thoroughly because any change in the technique will lead to changes in the rigidity of the bandage and early wastage. The semi-rigid bandage can also be used for the functional treatment of patients who are allergic to tape. Of more interest are the other fields of application in which this new material can be used, e.g. orthopaedic corsets, after-treatment for knee arthroscopies, achilles tendon ruptures, or even for wrist fractures. It is concluded that, alone or in combination with other cast-immobilization techniques, the semi-rigid 'Scotchrap' bandage represents a welcome and useful contribution to the existing assortment of bandage materials."

The aim of the study was to examine sports injury pattern and establish cost of injuries in relation to training of 58 competitive badminton players in a Malaysian National Sports School. Methods. This one-year prospective observational study recruited all the 13-16 year old students after obtaining informed consent from their appointed guardian. All participants were requested to report any injuries, which were pain or disabilities that occur within the study period (September 1, 2008 to August 31, 2009) either during training or competition. Injured students were to seek treatment from the researcher(s) who made weekly visits and they were then followed up accordingly until they return to full training. Details and progress of the injuries were documented during each visit. Results. Sixty-three injuries were recorded. Soft tissue sprains/strains were the commonest injury (64%). About one third of the injuries occurred in the lower limb especially the knees and was followed by back injuries; 38% of the injuries did not require training modification, half of these injuries resumed training within one week. Upon full training, half of them were still symptomatic. Injury risk was 57%; injury rate was 0.9 injuries/ player/1000 training hours. Conclusion. Badminton injuries mostly involved the lower limb and almost all overuse injuries occurred in the lower limb. However, badminton injuries as a whole were predominantly sprains and strains, and not overuse in nature as widely believed."

The aim of this study was to determine the injury rates of a Men's Varsity Ice Hockey team over six-years. Data on ice hockey injury rates and profile continue to increase in the hope of assisting with injury prevention. Methods. The University of British Columbia Men's Varsity team has been followed prospectively over a six-year period. All student-athletes completed a preseason medical examinations and physiological assessments. The team physician evaluated each injury and the team therapist completed the injury report forms and the attendance records for each player. Results. A total of 46 215 player exposures were recorded. The combined injury rate was 3.70 injuries/1 000 player game and practice exposures. A statistically significantly higher risk of injury was observed during games and the greatest risk of injury was observed during the second period. Forwards sustained greater percentage of injuries compared to defensemen and goalies. Sprains and strains accounted for 40% of all injuries, followed by concussions (13%). Non-contact injuries were most common, while the anatomy sustaining the most injuries was the head/neck/face region. A high percent-age of the recorded injuries required less than seven days to return to full activity. Conclusion. The risk of injury for university ice hockey players is greater during games and is dependant on playing position. Players are prone to sprains and strains, which may not involve any contact. Concussion and knee joint injury rates continue to cause concern."
2295,Medical , Sprains and Strains  , Ankle; Sprains and strains; Football; Risk factors        ,"Aim. The authors proposed to retrospectively assess the incidence of ankle sprain and the relevant risk factors in footballers playing in the teams of the province of Parma during a professional season. Methods. Sixty-six football clubs from the province of Parma associated with the Italian Football Federation were contacted. Each athlete involved filled out a questionnaire. Results. Fifty-three athletes out of 1452 had suffered a case of ankle sprain during the professional season; 3.76% of these were amateurs, 2.1% were semi-professionals, and 18.2% were professionals. It was highlighted that in the majority of cases the ankle sprain was caused by contact during the game and that there were significant relations between the distortion and the period of the year, the number of weekly training sessions, the type of footwear worn, the characteristics of the pitch and the presence of past traumas. Discussion. The level of sports activity appears to be an important factor in injury-related risks, the resumption of the professional activity between August and October is related to a higher incidence of traumatisms. A more intense training session seems to protect from traumas, while the incidence of sprain does not appear to be related to the role of the player. Conclusion. There are different causes of ankle sprain in footballers. To reduce the incidence of these traumas it is advisable to apply adequate preventive measures on the basis of the most frequent risk factors."

There is a longstanding debate over the long-term effect of intensive endurance training on cardiac function. Usually, echocardiography has been used as a global evaluation of left ventricular (LV) or right ventricular (RV) function and dimensions. Recently, speckle tracking strain (ST) has provided an analysis of regional RV and LV function. Thus, the intention of the study was to carefully evaluate cardiac function in a group of former world class swimmers applying longitudinal strain (LS) and circumferential strain (CS) analysis. Methods. Twelve athletes (45 +/- 1.5 years) of a former training group involved in high intensity endurance training were examined 24.9 +/- 4.3 years after the end of their active swimming career. An echocardiography was performed and LV function was analyzed based on CS and LS. Also, LS was evaluated for the RV. All measurements were performed for epicardium and endocardium independently. Results. Mean LV endocardial LS was -20.0 +/- 6.3 and epicardial LS -20.2 +/- 6.2. LV endocardial CS was -21.3 +/- 8.0 and epicardial CS -11.9 +/- 4.2. RV endocardial LS had a mean value of -26.4 +/- 6.1 and epicardial LS of -28.2 +/- 5.6. Conclusion. Twenty-five years after the cessation of endurance training, there was no evidence of a deterioration of RV or LV function as values for RV and LV strain measurements were within normal ranges."
1853,Medical , Stress Management  , economy; recession; employee stress; strain; satisfaction        ,"Across the globe, economic fluctuations have taken their toll on both organizations and employees, particularly during sustained recessions. Surprisingly, little research, however, has directly investigated the effects of recessions on employees. As such, the goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of specific recession-related stressors on employee outcomes (strain and satisfaction). We investigated an archival data set of 7666 individuals collected as part of the Workplace Employment Relations Study for relations among recession-related stressors with strain and job satisfaction variables. We found that recession-related stressors were significantly related to both strain and satisfaction. More specifically, certain recession-related stressors (e.g. increased workload and reorganization of work) were more strongly related to strain and satisfaction than others. These results imply the need for greater attention to stress management strategies aimed at helping both employees and their organizations cope with the human costs of economic recessions.

Mindfulness interventions are increasingly being implemented in high schools to improve students' stress management and psychosocial outcomes. Despite the well-researched role of primary and secondary control strategies in the management of adolescent stress, the impact of mindfulness on these attributions has not been examined. The current study addressed this gap in the extant literature. A mindfulness-based martial arts program was delivered to 17 high school students at risk for self-regulation challenges. Measures of primary and secondary control and cognitive errors were completed at pre- and post-treatment and compared to a waitlist control (n = 18). Findings suggested that students in the mindfulness program showed significant improvements in secondary control and reductions in cognitive errors from pre- to post-treatment compared to the waitlist control. No significant group by time changes were found for primary control. Findings are discussed in relation to changes in control-related attributions associated with cognitive behavioral therapy, with specific consideration of possible mechanisms by which mindfulness may improve secondary control and decrease cognitive errors. Directions for future research are discussed."

Stress and exposure to violence (e.g., intimate partner violence (IPV), nonpartner violence) are predictors of poor quality of life for adult women; however, these associations remain understudied among adolescent and young mothers in urban areas. Guided by the social ecological model, the current study created a latent variable, urban social stress, to examine the impact of the urban social environment (i.e., stressful life events, discrimination, family stress, and neighborhood problems) on the quality of life of adolescent and young mothers during both pregnancy and postpartum. The current study is a secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study of 296 expectant young mothers recruited at obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Results from structural equation and multigroup models found that higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life during pregnancy, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-exposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. In the postpartum period, higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-unexposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. Stress reduction programs need to help adolescent and young mothers in urban areas develop stress management skills specific to urban social stress. Pregnancy and parenting programs need to be tailored to the specific needs of young mothers in urban areas by becoming sensitive to the role of IPV and nonpartner violence in these young women's lives."

Smokers tend to identify more strongly with African American culture. Qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit perceptions toward smoking and intervention content. Seventy-one African American smokers recruited from community locations participated. The majority stated they would not use any cessation aids if trying to quit smoking, despite the availability of free nicotine replacement. Acculturative stress scores were significantly higher in younger participants and those with higher income. Higher African American acculturation did not predict smoking cessation intervention preference. Family and social relationships were cited as both reasons for wanting to quit and reasons for continuing to smoke. Based on these findings, interventions for urban African Americans should address household members continuing to smoke, social/family connections, stress management, and cultural identification in urban areas."

The present study investigates the evolution of illicit drug use among Romanian university students from 1999 to 2011. Methods. The study was performed in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in three phases: in 1999 (T1), in 2003 (T2) and in 2011 (T3). The study was carried out by means of anonymous questionnaires among university students aged 19-24. Results. The results show that among girls the lifetime illicit drugs use increased statistically significantly from 2.5% in 1999 to 7.5% in 2003 and to 15% in 2011. Among boys the trend was also increasing, the prevalence of illicit drug use was 14.2% at T1, 18.1% at T2, and it increased dramatically to 30.6% at T3. The percentage of students reporting cannabis use was almost identical with the total prevalence of illicit drug use. Ecstasy was the second most frequent drug used by the students; its consumption had also an increasing trend during the examined periods (from 0 to 5.6% among girls and from 0.8% to 11.2% among boys). The results of the bivariate correlation analyses show that lifetime illicit drug use was associated with having friends who experimented with illicit drugs both among boys and girls. Moreover, girls who declared stress management problems and depressive episodes were more likely to try illicit drugs, while among boys illicit drug use was associated with poorer academic performance. Conclusions. The data pointed out by our study call for comprehensive actions regarding the prevention of illicit drug use among Romanian young people."

Here, the deactivation of 5-bromouracil after ultraviolet irradiation is investigated in the singlet and triplet manifold by accurate quantum chemistry calculations and non-adiabatic dynamics simulations. It is found that, after irradiation to the bright pp* state, three main relaxation pathways are, in principle, possible: relaxation back to the ground state, intersystem crossing (ISC) and C-Br photodissociation. Based on accurate MS-CASPT2 optimizations, we propose that ground-state relaxation should be the predominant deactivation pathway in the gas phase. We then employ different electronic structure methods to assess their suitability to carry out excited-state dynamics simulations. MRCIS (multi-reference configuration interaction including single excitations) was used in surface hopping simulations to compute the ultrafast ISC dynamics, which mostly involves the (1)n(O)pi* and (3)pi pi* states.

Real samples of food products consumed by students at home (students as samplers) were employed as teaching material in three different courses of Genetics during the academic year 2014-2015: Experimental Methods in Food Production (MBTA) (Master level), and Applied Molecular Biology (BMA) and Conservation Genetics and Breeding (COMGE) (Bachelor/Degree level). Molecular genetics based on PCR amplification of DNA markers was employed for species identification of 22 seafood products in COMGE and MBTA, and for detection of genetically modified (GM) maize from nine products in BMA. In total six seafood products incorrectly labeled (27%), and two undeclared GM maize (22%) were found. A postLaboratory survey was applied for assessing the efficacy of the approach for improving motivation in the Laboratory Practices of Genetics. Results confirmed that students that worked on their own samples from local markets were significantly more motivated and better evaluated their Genetic laboratory practices than control students (chi(2) = 12.11 p=0.033). Our results suggest that citizen science approaches could not be only useful for improving teaching of Genetics in universities but also to incorporate students and citizens as active agents in food control.

This process is known to be regulated by the multi-domain Bcl-2 family proteins. For example, the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are responsible for forming pores at MOM. The anti-apoptotic proteins (including Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL), on the other hand, can inhibit this pore-forming process. Interestingly, although these two subgroups of proteins perform opposite apoptotic functions, their structures are very similar. This raises two highly interesting questions: (1) Why do these structurally similar proteins play opposite roles in apoptosis? (2) What are the roles of different functional domains of a Bcl-2 family protein in determining its apoptotic property? In this study, we generated a series of deletion mutants and substitution chimera, and used a combination of molecular biology, bio-informatics and living cell imaging techniques to answer these questions. Our major findings are: (1) All of the Bcl-2 family proteins appear to possess an intrinsic pro-apoptotic property. (2) The N-termini of these proteins play an active role in suppressing their pro-apoptotic function. (3) The apoptotic potency is positively correlated with membrane affinity of the alpha 5/6 helix domains. (4) Charge distribution flanking the alpha 5/6 helices is also important for the apoptotic potency. These findings explain why different members of Bcl-2 family proteins with similar domain composition can function oppositely in the apoptotic process."

However, identifying functional gene regulatory elements has been challenging in the context of developing tissues where material is limited and cell types are mixed. To identify regulatory sites during sex determination, we subjected Sertoli cells from mouse fetal testes to DNaseI-seq and ChIP-seq for H3K27ac. DNaseI-seq identified putative regulatory sites around genes enriched in Sertoli and pregranulosa cells; however, active enhancers marked by H3K27ac were enriched proximal to only Sertoli-enriched genes. Sequence analysis identified putative binding sites of known and novel transcription factors likely controlling Sertoli cell differentiation. As a validation of this approach, we identified a novel Sertoli cell enhancer upstream of Wt1, and used it to drive expression of a transgenic reporter in Sertoli cells. This work furthers our understanding of the complex genetic network that underlies sex determination and identifies regions that potentially harbor non-coding mutations underlying disorders of sexual development."

A fundamental question to be solved in this approach is how to drive stem cell differentiation onto the different lung cell phenotypes. Whereas the use of soluble factors as agents to modulate the fate of stem cells was established from an early stage of the research with this type of cells, it took longer to recognize that the physical microenvironment locally sensed by stem cells (e.g. substrate stiffness, 3D architecture, cyclic stretch, shear stress, air-liquid interface, oxygenation gradient) also contributes to their differentiation. The potential role played by physical stimuli would be particularly relevant in lung bioengineering since cells within the organ are physiologically subjected to two main stimuli required to facilitate efficient gas exchange: air ventilation and blood perfusion across the organ. The present review focuses on describing how the cell mechanical microenvironment can modulate stem cell differentiation and how these stimuli could be incorporated into lung bioreactors for optimizing organ bioengineering."

It has long been recognized that the size of the nucleus generally scales with the size of the cell, notably during embryogenesis when dramatic reductions in both cell and nuclear sizes occur. Mechanisms of nuclear size regulation are largely unknown and may be relevant to cancer where altered nuclear size is a key diagnostic and prognostic parameter. In vivo approaches to identifying nuclear size regulators are complicated by the essential and complex nature of nuclear function. The in vitro approach described here to study nuclear size control takes advantage of the normal reductions in nuclear size that occur during Xenopus laevis development. First, nuclei are assembled in X. laevis egg extract. Then, these nuclei are isolated and resuspended in cytoplasm from late stage embryos. After a 30 - 90 min incubation period, nuclear surface area decreases by 20 - 60%, providing a useful assay to identify cytoplasmic components present in late stage embryos that contribute to developmental nuclear size scaling. A major advantage of this approach is the relative facility with which the egg and embryo extracts can be biochemically manipulated, allowing for the identification of novel proteins and activities that regulate nuclear size. As with any in vitro approach, validation of results in an in vivo system is important, and microinjection of X. laevis embryos is particularly appropriate for these studies."

Long known to harbor electron transport chain proteins, crista membrane integrity is key to establishment of the proton gradient that drives oxidative phosphorylation. Visualization of cristae morphology by electron microscopy/tomography has provided evidence that cristae are tube-like extensions of the mitochondria] inner membrane (IM) that project into the matrix space. Reconciling ultrastructural data with the lipid composition of the IM provides support for a continuously curved cylindrical bilayer capped by a dome-shaped tip. Strain imposed by the degree of curvature is relieved by an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in monolayer leaflets that comprise cristae membranes. The signature mitochondrial lipid, cardiolipin (similar to 18% of IM phospholipid mass), and phosphatidylethanolamine (34%) segregate to the negatively curved monolayer leaflet facing the crista lumen while the opposing, positively curved, matrix-facing monolayer leaflet contains predominantly phosphatidylcholine. Associated with cristae are numerous proteins that function in distinctive ways to establish and/or maintain their lipid repertoire and structural integrity. By combining unique lipid components with a set of protein modulators, crista membranes adopt and maintain their characteristic morphological and functional properties. Once established, cristae ultrastructure has a direct impact on oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, fusion/fission as well as diseases of compromised energy metabolism. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We have developed an organotypic slice preparation of the normal portions of human pancreas obtained from cancer resections. The preparation was assessed for physiologic and pathologic responses to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (Cch) and cholecystokinin (CCK-8), including 1) amylase secretion, 2) exocytosis, 3) intracellular Ca2+ responses, 4) cytoplasmic autophagic vacuole formation, and 5) protease activation. Cch and CCK-8 both dose-dependently stimulated secretory responses from human pancreas slices similar to those previously observed in dispersed rodent acini. Confocal microscopy imaging showed that these responses were accounted for by efficient apical exocytosis at physiologic doses of both agonists and by apical blockade and redirection of exocytosis to the basolateral plasma membrane at supramaximal doses. The secretory responses and exocytotic events evoked by CCK-8 were mediated by CCK-A and not CCK-B receptors. Physiologic agonist doses evoked oscillatory Ca2+ increases across the acini. Supraphysiologic doses induced formation of cytoplasmic autophagic vacuoles and activation of proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin). Maximal atropine pretreatment that completely blocked all the Cch-evoked responses did not affect any of the CCK-8-evoked responses, indicating that rather than acting on the nerves within the pancreas slice, CCK cellular actions directly affected human acinar cells. Human pancreas slices represent excellent preparations to examine pancreatic cell biology and pathobiology and could help screen for potential treatments for human pancreatitis."

Specific Rab protein together with the cognate effectors coordinates the dynamics of trafficking pathway and determines the cargo proteins destination. Functional impairments of Rab proteins by mutations or post-translational modifications disrupting the regulatory network of vesicle trafficking have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Therefore, the vesicle transport regulators play essential roles in the mediation of cancer cell biology, including uncontrolled cell growth, invasion and metastasis. The context-dependent role of the same Rab to act as either an oncoprotein or tumor suppressor in different cancers is found. Such discrepancies may be due in part to the interaction of specific Rab protein with different effectors or cargos in various tumors. Here, we review recent advances in the roles of Rab GTPases in communicating with other effectors in tumor progression. In this review, we also emphasize dysregulation of Rab-mediated membrane delivery shifting normal cell behaviors toward malignancy. Thus, recovery of the dysregulated vesicle trafficking systems in cancer cells may provide future directions for potential strategy to restrain tumor progression."

Metabolism of ABT-107 was investigated in in vitro hepatic systems, in rat and monkey receiving [C-14] ABT-107, and in vivo plasma in rat, dog, monkey and human. 2. In in vitro hepatic systems, ABT-107 was primarily cleared via oxidative metabolism, and proceeded via two parallel pathways. Pathway 1, ABT-107 was oxidized at the nitrogen of quinuclidine moiety to form M1. Pathway 2, oxidation occurred at indole-containing moiety to form M2. Metabolism via N-oxidation was predominant in dog and rat, while in monkey and human, metabolism proceeded primarily via oxidation of indole-containing moiety. 3. ABT-107 was extensively metabolized in vivo in rat and monkey. M1 was primarily found in rat urine and bile; whereas, M2 was the major metabolite in monkey urine and feces. M1 was the predominant circulating metabolite in dog and rat. M2 was the primary circulating metabolite in monkey and human. 4. Enzymatic studies suggested M1 formation was primarily mediated by renal FMO1. CYP3A4, 1A2, 2J2 and 2D6 were primary enzymes catalyzing M2 formation. 5. Biotransformation of ABT-107 in human and monkey is markedly different from that in dog and rat, suggesting that monkey is an appropriate model for predicting human biotransformation and toxicology of ABT-107."

These urinary metabolites indicated that the metabolic pathways of PV9 include: (1) the reduction of ketone groups to their corresponding alcohols; (2) oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to the corresponding pyrrolidone; (3) aliphatic oxidation of the terminal carbon atom to the corresponding carboxylate form, possibly through an alcohol intermediate (not detected); and (4) hydroxylation at the penultimate carbon atom to the corresponding alcohols followed by further oxidation to ketones, and combinations of these steps. In addition, results from the quantitative analyses of five phase-I metabolites using newly synthesized authentic standards suggested that the main metabolic pathway includes the aliphatic oxidation of terminal and/or penultimate carbons. Human metabolism of PV9 differed significantly from those of alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone and alpha-pyrrolidinobutiophenone, suggesting that the main metabolic pathways of alpha-pyrrolidinophenones significantly change depending on the alkyl chain length of the parent molecule."

For over 80years the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumption for human health has been established. The FDA recently approved the use of -3 PUFAs in supplements. Additionally, the market for -3 PUFA ingredients grew by 24.3% last year, which affirms their popularity and public awareness of their benefits. PUFAs are essential for normal human growth; however, only minor quantities of the beneficial -3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are synthesized by human metabolism. Rather PUFAs are obtained via dietary or nutritional supplementation and modified into other beneficial metabolites. A vast literature base is available on the health benefits and biological roles of -3 PUFAs and their metabolism; however, information on their dietary sources and palatability of foods incorporated with -3 PUFAs is limited. DHA and EPA are added to many foods that are commercially available, such as infant and pet formulae, and they are also supplemented in animal feed to incorporate them in consumer dairy, meat, and poultry products. The chief sources of EPA and DHA are fish oils or purified preparations from microalgae, which when added to foods, impart a fishy flavor that is considered unacceptable. This fishy flavor is completely eliminated by extensively purifying preparations of n-3 PUFA sources. While n-3 PUFA lipid autoxidation is considered the main cause of fishy flavor, the individual oxidation products identified thus far, such as unsaturated carbonyls, do not appear to contribute to fishy flavor or odor. Alternatively, various compound classes such as free fatty acids and volatile sulfur compounds are known to impart fishy flavor to foods. Identification of the causative compounds to reduce and eventually eliminate fishy flavor is important for consumer acceptance of PUFA-fortified foods."

The network contains nearly 3000 metabolic reactions, which were reorganized into about 70 human-specific metabolic pathways according to their functional relationships. By analysis of the functional connectivity of the metabolites in the network, the bow-tie structure, which was found previously by structure analysis, is reconfirmed. Furthermore, the distribution of the disease related genes in the network suggests that the IN (substrates) subset of the bow- tie structure has more flexibility than other parts."

Therefore, highly sensitive determination of lysozyme is necessary and vital in a wide variety of fields. In this work, we put forward a simple but effective strategy for colorimetric visualization of lysozyme based on iodide-responsive Cu@Au nanoparticles (Cu@Au NPs) as well as the iodide-catalyzed H2O2-TMB (3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine) reaction system. Colorimetric detection is applied because of its simplicity, fast response for analysis, high detection limit, low costs and practicality. In our strategy, iodide is applied for the reason that it can induce an obvious color change of the Cu@Au nanoparticles solution from gray to red, along with the change of morphologies of the Cu@Au nanoparticles from irregular to spherical. Consequently, this phenomenon results in colorimetric signal variation of the iodide-catalytic H2O2-TMB system. What's more, by quite simple biomolecule modification on the Cu@Au nanoparticles surface, an all-purpose colorimetric platform is established for the accurate detection of lysozyme, which could lead to the change of Cu@Au NP concentration through molecular recognition. The results show that modified Cu-Au NPs successfully achieved a simple, selective, visualized, and ultrasensitive detection of lysozyme with a linear range from 10(-7) to 10(-3) M and a detection limit of 60 nM."

No injectable malaria vaccine has demonstrated long-term protection against CHMI using Pf parasites heterologous to the vaccine strain. Here, we conducted an open-label trial with PfSPZ Vaccine at a dose of 9.0 x 10(5) PfSPZ administered i.v. three times at 8-wk intervals to 15 malaria-naive adults. After CHMI with homologous Pf parasites 19 wk after final immunization, nine (64%) of 14 (95% CI, 35-87%) vaccinated volunteers remained without parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls (P = 0.012). Of the nine nonparasitemic subjects, six underwent repeat CHMI with heterologous Pf7G8 parasites 33 wk after final immunization. Five (83%) of six (95% CI, 36-99%) remained without parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls. PfSPZ- specific T-cell and antibody responses were detected in all vaccine recipients. Cytokine production by T cells from vaccinated subjects after in vitro stimulation with homologous (NF54) or heterologous (7G8) PfSPZ were highly correlated. Interestingly, PfSPZ-specific T-cell responses in the blood peaked after the first immunization and were not enhanced by subsequent immunizations. Collectively, these data suggest durable protection against homologous and heterologous Pf parasites can be achieved with PfSPZ Vaccine. Ongoing studies will determine whether protective efficacy can be enhanced by additional alterations in the vaccine dose and number of immunizations."

Although Th9 cells are important in many diseases, their contribution to allergic rhinitis (AR) remains unclear. We therefore first determined whether Th9 cells were presentin a mouse model of AR. We then investigated the their involvement in the distribution of CD4+ T-cell subsets and the symptoms of AR by treating mice with anti-IL-9 antibodies (Abs). Anti-IL-9 Abs were administered intranasally during rechallenge of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR in BALB/c mice. We measured nasal rubbing motion, sneezing and eosinophils, as well as the Th1 (Th1 cell percentage, Ifn-gamma. mRNA/protein, T-bet mRNA), Th2 (Th2 cell percentage, Il-4 mRNA/protein, Gata3 mRNA), Th9 (Th9 cell percentages Il-9 mRNA/protein, PU. 1 and Irf4 mRNA), Th17 (Th17 cell percentage, Il-17 mRNA/protein, Ror.t mRNA), and Treg (Treg cell percentage, Foxp3 mRNA) responses in the nasal mucosa. Treatment with anti-IL-9 Abs markedly reduced nasal rubbing, sneezing, eosinophil infiltration, and Th2, Th9, and Th17 responses, and increased the Treg response. Our findings emphasize the importance of IL-9/Th9 in the pathogenesis of AR, and suggest that anti-IL-9 Ab treatment may be an effective therapeutic strategy for AR."

In vitro ImmunoCap IgE assay was positive to latex (1.30 kUa/L), subsequent patch testing for contact dermatitis provoked a reaction for benzophenone-4, (a UV stabalizer) and Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy identified the elastic as ethylene propylene rubber, containing additional unidentified compounds. Allergy to natural rubber latex occurs in as many as 6% of Americans and Australians. Around three million American residents are thought to scuba dive each year.

Predator-prey interactions are often assessed by examining stomach contents. However, partially digested remains may be difficult to accurately identify by traditional visual analysis. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of DNA barcoding to identify digested piscine prey remains in invasive Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus, non-native, but established Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and native White Catfish Ameiurus catus from Chesapeake Bay, USA. Stomach contents were examined and piscine prey items were scored as lightly digested, moderately digested or severely digested. A 652 base pair region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI-5P) mitochondrial DNA gene was sequenced for each prey item. Edited barcode sequences were compared to locally-caught and validated reference sequences in BOLD (Barcode of Life Database). A large majority of prey items were sufficiently digested to limit morphological identification (9.4 % to species and an additional 12.1 % to family). However, overall barcoding success was high (90.3 %) with little difference among the digestion classifications. Combining morphological and genetic identifications, we classified 91.6 % of fish prey items to species. Twenty-three fish species were identified, including species undergoing active restoration efforts (e.g., Alosa spp.) and commercially important species, e.g., Striped Bass Morone saxatilis, White Perch Morone americana, American Eel Anguilla rostrata and Menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus. We found DNA barcoding highly successful at identifying all but the most heavily degraded prey items and to be an efficient and effective method for obtaining diet information to strengthen the resolution of trophic analyses including diet comparisons among sympatric native and non-native predators."

Here, we report a model that provides a good statistical fit to allele-frequency correlation patterns among East Asians, Australasians, Native Americans, and ancient western and northern Eurasians, together with archaic human groups. The model features a primary eastern/western bifurcation dating to at least 45,000 years ago, with Australasians nested inside the eastern clade, and a parsimonious set of admixture events. While our results still represent a simplified picture, they provide a useful summary of deep Eurasian population history that can serve as a null model for future studies and a baseline for further discoveries."

Moreover, leaf is an organ of transpiration, and leaf area index is a basic variable to estimate this water lost, but it is still a weak spot in the crop growth estimation. In this paper, two different leaf area index models are established and compared with the evolution of the real crop determined with an electronic planimeter: (1) Considering the temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as the main impact factors over crop growth, a TEP-LAI model based on product of thermal effectiveness and PAR is built to estimate the leaf area index dynamics; and (2) TOM-LAI model based on a tomato growth model is also used to estimate the leaf area index as an explicit function of the number of leaves and vines. Finally, the results of both simulation models (TEP-LAI and TOM-LAI) are compared with the measured values. Moreover, a crop transpiration model is established using the empirical data sampled in a multi-span greenhouse in Almeria (Spain). In this greenhouse, a microlysimeter (two different weight scales) was used to obtain the transpiration and the drainage values. Thus, the data collected is used to obtain a model of the estimated water lost by transpiration, that it is based on Back Propagation-Neural Network was optimized using genetic algorithm and Nonlinear Auto-regressive model with Exogenous Inputs model. Once described the different models, the estimated values of leaf area index are compared satisfactorily with the measured ones. TEP-LAI is the model chosen to be introduced as input of the final transpiration model.

Understanding the mechanism of this unique enzyme is critical for developing new anti-infective agents that selectively target isoprenoid biosynthesis. The present study used mutagenesis and a combination of protein fluorescence, CD and kinetics experiments to investigate the roles of Arg420, Arg478 and Tyr392 in substrate binding and catalysis. The results support a random sequential, preferred order mechanism, and predict that Arg420 and Arg478 are involved in binding of the acceptor substrate, GraP. D-Glyceraldehyde, an alternative acceptor substrate lacking the phosphoryl group predicted to interact with Arg420 and Arg478, also accelerates decarboxylation of the predecarboxylation intermediate C2 alpha-lactylthiamin diphosphate (LThDP) on DXP synthase, indicating that this binding interaction is not absolutely required, and that the hydroxyaldehyde sufficiently triggers decarboxylation. Unexpectedly, Tyr392 contributes to GraP affinity, and is not required for LThDP formation or its GraP-promoted decarboxylation. Time-resolved CD spectroscopy and NMR experiments indicate that LThDP is significantly stabilized on R420A and Y392F variants as compared with wild-type DXP synthase in the absence of acceptor substrate, but these substitutions do not appear to affect the rate of GraP-promoted LThDP decarboxylation in the presence of high levels of GraP, and LThDP formation remains the rate-limiting step. These results suggest a role of these residues in promoting GraP binding, which in turn facilitates decarboxylation, and also highlight interesting differences between DXP synthase and other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes."

The respective activating enzyme (4Hpad-AE) displays two cysteine-rich motifs in addition to the classical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding cluster (RS cluster) motif. These additional motifs are also present in other glycyl radical activating enzymes (GR-AE) and it has been postulated that these orthologues may use an alternative SAM homolytic cleavage mechanism, generating a putative 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical and 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio)adenosine but not a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and methionine. 4Hpad-AE produced from a codon-optimized synthetic gene binds a maximum of two [4Fe-4S](2+/+) clusters as revealed by EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The enzyme only catalyses the turnover of SAM under reducing conditions, and the reaction products were identified as 5'-deoxyadenosine (quenched form of 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical) and methionine. We demonstrate that the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical is the activating agent for 4Hpad through p-cresol formation and correlation between the production of 5'-deoxyadenosine and the generation of glycyl radical in 4Hpad. Therefore, we conclude that 4Hpad-AE catalyses a classical SAM-dependent glycyl radical formation as reported for GR-AE without auxiliary clusters. Our observation casts doubt on the suggestion that GR-AE containing auxiliary clusters catalyse the alternative cleavage reaction detected for glycerol dehydratase activating enzyme."

Although mammalian LOX-isoforms share a high degree of structural similarity X-ray coordinates indicated that the substrate-binding pocket of ALOX5 is some 20% bigger than that of ALOX15 suggesting the possibility of interconverting the two isoenzymes. To test this ""space-based"" hypothesis we reduced the volume of the substrate-binding pocket of mouse Alox5 by introducing space-filling amino acids at critical positions and found that multiple mutations at Phe359, Ala424, Asn425 and Ala603 of Alox5 led to gradual increase in 15-HETE formation. The Phe359Trp + Ala424IIe + Asn425Met Alox5 triple mutant was a major (67 +/- 2%) 15-lipoxygenating enzyme and similar data were confirmed for human ALOX5. Structural modeling on the basis of the X-ray coordinates of ALOX5 indicated that the volume of the substrate-binding pocket inversely correlates with the share of 15-HETE biosynthesis for the human (r(2) = 0.79, p < 0.05) and the mouse (r(2) = 0.59, p < 0.01) enzyme. This data proves the principle possibility of converting pro-inflammatory 5-lipoxygenases to anti-inflammatory 15-lipoxygenases by reducing the volume of the substrate-binding pocket.

It strongly endorses the viewpoint that selective modifications of ""marks"" on DNA and histones constitute the crucial codes of life, a proposition which is hotly contested (Ptashne et al., in 2010). This proposition reflects the current mindset that DNA and histone modifications are the prime movers in gene regulation during evolution. This claim is perplexing, since the well characterized organisms., Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, lack methylated DNA ""marks"" and the DNA methytransferase enzymology. Despite their complete absence, D. melanogaster nevertheless has extensive gene regulatory networks which drive sophisticated development, gastrulation, migration of germ cells and yield a nervous system with significant neural attributes. In stark contrast, the honey bee Apis mellifera deploys its human-type DNA methyltransferase enzymology to ""mark"" its DNA and it too has sophisticated development. What roles therefore is DNA methylation playing in different animals? The honey bee brings a fresh perspective to this question. Its combinatorial chemistry of pheromones, tergal and cuticular exudates provide an exquisite communication system between thousands of individuals. The development of queen and worker is strictly controlled by differential feeding of royal jelly and their adult behaviors are accompanied by epigenomic changes. Their interfaces with different ""environments"" are extensive, allowing an evaluation of the roles of epigenomes in behavior in a natural environment, in the space of a few weeks, and at requisite levels of experimental rigor.

During the long-term operation of 3 years, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency reached over 90% on average and the sludge yield in the rCAA system was 0.098 kg suspended sludge (SS) kg(-1) COD, which was approximately 36.3% of that in a conventional activated sludge process at an influent COD of 700-800 mg L-1 and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 15 h. Analysis of soluble components, sludge characteristics, microorganism community and metabolic activities in the rCAA system showed that, when the sludge in the aerobic zone flowed into the anaerobic zone, sludge destruction and degradation occurred. Intracellular organic substances were then released and further hydrolyzed to small molecular compounds. These intermediate substances were degraded in subsequent aerobic compartments. In this way, cryptic growth of the sludge was realized that could contribute to sludge reduction. Microbial ecological analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) further showed that the rCAA process spatially domesticated the different microbial communities along the flow direction of the bioreactor, which enhanced excess sludge lysis and transformation, cryptic growth and bacterial predation.

A fully disposable chemically-heated thermal processor is developed to heat the capillary tube from the bottom at a fixed temperature for amplification without the need for electrical power. Amplification is achieved when reagents in the capillary tube are spontaneously and repeatedly transported through different temperature zones, which significantly shortens the amplification time by eliminating the need for controlled time-domain temperature cycling. A rapid one-step nucleic acid dipstick assay is adopted to facilitate the detection of amplification products with the eye instead of instrumentation. The utility of our POC diagnostic system was demonstrated by detecting H1N1 virus with sensitivity of 1.0 TCID50/mL within 35 min. The developed system is particularly desired for resource poor settings, for example, developing countries, outside centralized laboratories, doctor's offices and homes, to relieve the requirements for laboratory facilities and trained personnel.

1527,biochemistry , Polymerase chain reaction  , penile neoplasms; carcinoma; squamous cell; male; papillomavirus infections        ,"A third to half of penile invasive squamous cell carcinomas are human papillomavirus (HPV) related. Warty (condylomatous), warty-basaloid, and basaloid carcinomas are the most common subtypes associated with HPV. Less frequent are clear cell and lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas. Here we report a novel penile tumor associated with HPV. Twelve cases were selected from 1010 penile carcinomas, part of an international HPV detection study conducted at the Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Spain. Immunostaining with p16(INK4a) was performed on all cases, and HPV-mRNA detection was also performed. En bloc full tumor staining was the utilized criteria for positivity of p16(INK4a). For HPV-DNA detection, wholetissue section polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed by SPF10-DEIA-LiPA(25) (version 1). The patients' ages ranged from 42 to 92 years (average, 71 y). The tumor was most commonly located in the glans. A characteristic microscopic finding was the presence of a moderate to dense tumor-associated inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, or eosinophils. Tumors grew in large solid sheets, nests, or had a trabecular pattern. Cells were large and poorly differentiated or anaplastic. Keratinization was minimal or absent. Nuclei were large with prominent nucleoli. Mitoses were numerous. Tumor necrosis was common. Deep invasion of the corpora cavernosa was frequent. p16(INK4a) and HPV-DNA were positive in all cases, whereas mRNA detection was positive in 9 cases only. The prevalent genotype was HPV16 (9 cases, 75%). Other genotypes were HPVs 58, 33, and 66. Medullary carcinomas of the penis are morphologically distinctive HPV-related high-grade neoplasms affecting older individuals. More studies are necessary to delineate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular features of this unusual penile neoplasm."
1542,biochemistry , Polymerase chain reaction  , Ixodid ticks; pathogen load; tularaemia        ,"A total of 7778 host-seeking adult Dermacentor reticulatus (Ixodida: Ixodidae) ticks were examined for the prevalence of Francisella tularensis holarctica (Thiotrichales: Francisellaceae) in a natural focus of tularaemia in the floodplain forest-meadow ecosystem along the lower reaches of the Dyje (Thaya) river in South Moravia (Czech Republic) between 1995 and 2013. Ticks were pooled (10 specimens per pool) and their homogenates inoculated subcutaneously in 4-week-old specific pathogen-free mice. Dead mice were sectioned, their spleens cultivated on thioglycollate-glucose-blood agar and impression smears from the spleen, liver and heart blood were Giemsa-stained. Sixty-four pools were positive for F.tularensis: the overall minimum infection rate (MIR) was 0.82%. Overall MIRs for the 4714 female and 3064 male D.reticulatus examined were 0.89 and 0.72%, respectively; MIRs fluctuated across years between 0.0 and 2.43%. The estimated bacterial load in infected ticks varied from 0.84 to 5.34 log(10) infectious F.tularensis cells per tick (i.e. from about seven to 220000 cells). Ticks with low loads were more prevalent; more than 1000 infectious cells were detected in 24 ticks (0.3% of all ticks and 37.5% of infected ticks). Monitoring of D.reticulatus for the presence and cell numbers of F.tularensis may be a valuable tool in the surveillance of tularaemia."
1643,biochemistry , Polymerase chain reaction  , Glioma; miR-1202; Rab1A; apoptosis; endoplasmic reticulum stress        ,"Aberrant expression of microRNAs correlates with the development and progression of human cancers by targeting downstream proteins. MiR-1202 is downregulated in ovarian cancer and clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma; however, its role in glioma remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the expression and the role of miR-1202 and to elucidate its regulatory mechanism in glioma. We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure miR-1202 expression in both glioma tissues and cell lines. The findings showed that the miR-1202 expression decreased dramatically in clinical glioma tissues and cell lines, and miR-1202 expression was inversely correlated with the expression of Rab1A. Using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays, we identified Rab1A as a novel and direct target of miR-1202. In vitro, overexpression of miR-1202 inhibited glioma cell proliferation and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis through targeting Rab1A, whereas suppression of miR-1202 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. Similarly, silencing Rab1A with small interfering RNA also suppressed glioma cell growth and induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate that miR-1202 suppresses proliferation and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis through targeting and inhibiting Rab1A in glioma cells. These results suggest miR-1202 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma patients."
1646,biochemistry , Polymerase chain reaction  , Scavenger receptor class B type 1; clear cell renal cell carcinoma; diagnostic value; prognostic value        ,"Aberrant expression of scavenger receptor class B type 1 has been reported in several human cancers. Nevertheless, the roles of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The messenger RNA level of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues was detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, while protein level was determined by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The lipid content between clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues and normal kidney tissues was differentiated by Oil Red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining. The diagnostic value of scavenger receptor class B type 1 was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve. The prognostic significance of scavenger receptor class B type 1 was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis. Our results showed that the expression of scavenger receptor class B type 1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma tissues at both messenger RNA and protein level was much higher than that in normal kidney tissues. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis exhibited a significant value of area under the curve (0.8486, 95% confidence interval: 0.7926-0.9045) with strong sensitivity (0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.6535-0.8312) and specificity (0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.8238-0.9510). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with higher scavenger receptor class B type 1 expression had shorter progression-free survival time. Cox analysis indicated that scavenger receptor class B type 1 was an independent prognostic biomarker. In conclusion, our findings implied that scavenger receptor class B type 1 might serve as a diagnostic and independent prognostic biomarker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma."
177,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , dimorphic yeast; biocontrol risks; genes subtraction; Prunus persica; Malus domestica        ,"A biofilm-forming strain of Pichia fermentans was found to be a very strong antagonist against brown rot and grey mold in artificially wounded apple fruit when co-inoculated with either Monilinia fructicola or Botrytis cinerea, respectively. The same strain of yeast, however, was an aggressive pathogen when inoculated on peach fruit, causing rot of fruit tissues, even in the absence of other pathogens. Optical and scanning electron microscopy showed that P. fermentans produces only yeast-like shaped cells during colonization of apple tissue, while exhibiting pseudohyphal growth on peach tissue. A rapid subtractive hybridization approach (RaSH) was used to identify differentially expressed genes in the pathogenic form of P. fermentans by comparing the cDNA of P. fermentans sampled after 24 hours growth on apple with the cDNA of the same strain grown 24 hours on peach fruit. A total of 450 clones were analysed by a reverse Northern Blotting technique, yielding some fragments which were significantly expressed on peach but less on apple tissue. These sequences were compared to the available genome sequences of another dimorphic yeast, Candida albicans, and homologous genes were identified. The relationship between these genes, dimorphism, and pathogenicity will be discussed."
200,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , FABP; amphioxus; chordate; evolution; expression; hybridization        ,"A cDNA clone encoding an amphioxus fatty acid binding protein-like (AmphiFABPL) protein was isolated from a gut cDNA library of Branchiostoma belcheri. It contained a 423 bp open reading frame corresponding to a deduced protein of 140 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 15.9 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis showed that AmphiFABPL fell outside the vertebrate clade of fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), being positioned at the base of the chordate lineage, and was almost equally homologous to various vertebrate FABPs, suggesting that it may be the archetype of vertebrate FABPs. Both northern blotting and in situ hybridization analyses demonstrated that AmphiFABPL was expressed in the hepatic caecum and hind-gut, and although at a much lower level, it was also present in the endostyle, ovary and testis. In addition, whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that AmphiFABPL was initially expressed in the posterior two thirds of the primitive gut, including the mid-gut where the hepatic caecum will form later, in 2-day larvae. The expression pattern is closely similar to that of the L-FABP and I-FABP genes in vertebrates, supporting the hypothesis that the hepatic caecum in the amphioxus is homologous to the vertebrate liver."
201,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , ABA; ABP1; dormancy; Eucommia ulmoides; IAA; quiescence; rest        ,"A cDNA clone of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. encoding auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1), one of the putative receptors of auxin, was isolated, and the seasonal expression of ABP1 in relation to IAA and ABA annual variation was investigated by different technical approaches including RT-PCR, real-time PCR, northern blotting, western blotting, and immunolocalization. In the cambial region, ABP1 expression at both the protein and the mRNA level was found to be high, low, and remarkably scarce in the active, quiescent, and resting stages, respectively, during cambium periodicity. The signal abundance of ABP1 follows the opposite pattern to ABA accumulation and correlates with auxin responsiveness of the cambial tissues, suggesting a role for ABP1 in mediating auxin-dependent regulation of cambial activation in the activity-dormancy cycle. This paper attempts to explain why IAA would 'boost' the reactivation of a quiescent cambium, and not that of a resting cambium. Results also show that ABP1 expression is improved by IAA, while inhibited by ABA."
202,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , ammonium; nitrate; Oryza sativa; OsMT3 gene; oxidative stress        ,"A cDNA sequence OsMT3 was initially isolated from the subtractive cDNA library of ammonium-fed rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaves, which was further confirmed by Northern blot to be highly ammonium-up-regulated as compared to nitrate. Its full-length cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR, and in silico analysis reveals that the cDNA includes an open reading frame of 186 bp and encodes a rice metallothionein type 3 peptide. Northern blotting analysis showed that OsMT3 gene predominantly expressed in rice leaves, weakly in stems, and barely in buds and roots. The gene transcripts in leaves were significantly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), low temperature, NaCl and Cu2+, but not by Pb2+. Activities of three anti-oxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidases) and two non-enzymic antioxidants (reduced ascorbate and reduced glutathione) little differed in ammonium-and nitrate-fed rice leaves, indicating that the induced OsMT3 expression was not mediated by ammonium-elicited oxidative signals."
327,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , cysteine protease; cysteine protease inhibitor; cystatin; hemolymph; Manduca sexta; overexpression        ,"A cysteine protease inhibitor (CPI) with an apparent molecular mass of 11.5 kDa was purified from larval hemolymph of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 followed by hydrophobic and ion-exchange column chromatographies. The purified cysteine proteinase inhibitor, denoted as MsCPI, strongly inhibited the plant cysteine protease, papain, with a K-i value of 5.5 x 10(-9)M. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a partial cDNA encoding MsCPI indicated that MsCPI consists of 105 amino acid residues in a sequence that is similar to sarcocystatin A from Sarcophaga peregrina. However, northern blotting and PCR analyses using the specific primers of MsCPI suggested that the mRNA encoding MsCPI had a size of more than 12 kilobases, which included at least six tandemly repeated MsCPI segments. MsCPI was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein effectively inhibited cysteine proteases from plants as well as from animals such as cathepsins B (K-i, 6.8 nM), H (3.0 nM), and L (0.87 nM). There was no inhibition exhibited toward trypsin, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, pepsin or themolysin. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
166,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , Rubredoxin; Expression; Banana; Stress response        ,"A banana (Musa AAA, Cavendish subgroup cv. Brazil) cDNA encoding a putative rubredoxin-like protein (MaRd1) was obtained from total RNA isolated from cold-treated banana leaves using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. MaRd1 cDNA contained 597 nucleotides encoding 198 amino acids in the open reading frame. MaRd1 protein showed 56% amino acid identity with that of Pyrococcus furiosus rubredoxin (P24297). A chloroplast transit peptide and a transmembrane region were detected at the N-terminus and the C-terminus, respectively, of the deduced amino acid sequence of MaRd1 gene. Southern blotting revealed the occurrence of at least two copies of MaRd1 in the banana genome. Real time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of MaRd1 gene was mainly in leaves, pseudo-stems and immature fruits, while it was barely detectable in roots and flowers. Cold and salt stresses induced higher levels of MaRd1 transcript accumulation in leaves. This finding indicated a role of MaRd1 in the response to these abiotic stresses."
172,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Transgene; Salt stress; Glycine betaine        ,"A betA gene encoding choline dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli (E. coli) was transformed into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. PCR amplification and Southern blotting confirmed the existence of transgene in transformed plants and their progeny. Levels of expression of the betA gene varied among the different transgenic lines based on RT-PCR analysis. Under salt stress conditions, transgenic lines L2 and L3 had higher levels of glycine betaine and chlorophyll, lower Na(+)/K(+) ratios and solute potential, and less cell membrane damage. These lines also retained moderately higher photosynthesis rates and more vigorous growth than the wild-type line at 200 mM NaCl. In a field trial in a high salt field, transgenic lines L2 and L3 had higher germination rates, more tillers and higher grain yields in comparison to the wild-type plants. This suggested that the transgenic plants were more tolerant to salt stress and have potential for breeding salt-tolerant wheat."
437,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , Banana (Musa acuminate L. AAA group); Citrate synthase; Ethylene; Ripening; Expression        ,"A full-length citrate synthase gene designated MaGCS was isolated from a banana fruit cDNA library, which contained a 1885 bp fragment carrying a 1542 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a 513 amino acid protein. MaGCS includes the glyoxysomal targeting signal PST2, an oxaloacetic acid binding site and a citrate synthase active site. Southern blotting showed that the banana genome has two copies of MaGCS. MaGCS is constitutively expressed in all organs with high levels in the fruit and the lowest levels in the leaves. With natural ripening, the MaGCS expression pattern was similar to that of ethylene production and respiration rate. MaGCS expression could be induced by ethylene and inhibited by the ethylene receptor inhibitor 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), which is in accordance with ripening-related ethylene synthesis and respiration rate, and demonstrates that MaGCS is associated with ethylene biosynthesis. Oxaloacetic acid (OA) accelerated fruit ripening, and in contrast, citric acid (CA) delayed it. The expression of MaGCS, the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase gene 1 (MaACO1, AJ223232) and the ACC synthase gene I (MaACS1, AB021906) was evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR), which showed that the expression of MaGCS, MaACO1, and MaACS1 were greatly improved by OA and suppressed by CA. These results indicate that MaGCS plays an important role in postharvest banana fruit ripening, and that OA and CA could affect fruit ripening. This effect on climacteric ethylene and ripening progress was due to the regulation of MaGCS, MaACO1, and MaACS1 expression. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
481,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , Genetic engineering; Green ash; Sonication; Transgenic; Vacuum-infiltration        ,"A genetic transformation protocol for green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) hypocotyl explants was developed. Green ash hypocotyls were transformed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 harboring binary vector pq35GR containing the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion gene, and an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. Pre-cultured hypocotyl explants were transformed in the presence of 100 mu M acetosyringone using 90 s sonication plus 10 min vacuum-infiltration. Kanamycin at 20 mg l(-1) was used for selecting transformed cells. Adventitious shoots regenerated on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 13.3 mu M 6-benzylaminopurine, 4.5 mu M thidiazuron, 50 mg l(-1) adenine sulfate, and 10% coconut water. GUS- and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive shoots from the cut ends of hypocotyls were produced via an intermediate callus stage. Presence of the GUS and nptII genes in GUS-positive shoots were confirmed by PCR and copy number of the nptII gene in PCR-positive shoots was determined by Southern blotting. Three transgenic plantlets were acclimatized to the greenhouse. This transformation and regeneration system using hypocotyls provides a foundation for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of green ash. Studies are underway using a construct containing the Cry8Da protein of Bacillus thuringiensis for genetic transformation of green ash."
486,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , C9orf72; Parkinsonism; Multiple system atrophy (MSA); Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS)        ,"A GGGGCC repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene was recently identified as a major cause of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. There is suggestion that these expansions may be a rare cause of parkinsonian disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Screening the C9orf72 gene in 37 patients with features of corticobasal syndrome (CBS) detected an expansion in 3 patients, confirmed by Southern blotting. In a series of 22 patients with clinically diagnosed PSP, we found 1 patient with an intermediate repeat length. We also screened for the C9orf72 expansion in a large series of neuro-pathologically confirmed samples with MSA (n = 96), PSP (n = 177), and CBD (n = 18). Patients were found with no more than 22 GGGGCC repeats. Although these results still need to be confirmed in a larger cohort of CBS and/or CBD patients, these data suggest that in the presence of a family history and/or motor neuron disease features, patients with CBS or clinical PSP should be screened for the C9orf72 repeat expansion. In addition, we confirm that the C9orf72 expansions are not associated with pathologically confirmed MSA, PSP, or CBD in a large series of cases. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
