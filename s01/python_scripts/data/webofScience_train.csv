(Method) The proposed methods first extracted 64 color histogram to obtain color information, and 16 wavelet packet entropy to obtain the texture information. With the aim of reducing the 80 features, principal component analysis was harnessed. The reduced features were used as input to generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM). Winner-takes-all (WTA) was used to handle the multiclass problem. Two kernels were tested, linear kernel and Radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Ten repetitions of 10-fold stratified cross validation technique were used to estimate the out-of-sample errors. We named our method as GEPSVM + RBF + WTA and GEPSVM + WTA. (Result) The results showed that PCA reduced the 80 features to merely five with explaining 99.90% of total variance. The recall rate of GEPSVM + RBF + WTA achieved the highest overall recall rate of 97.9%. (Conclusion) This was higher than the result of GEPSVM + WTA and other five state-of-the-art algorithms: back propagation neural network, RBF support vector machine, genetic neural-network, linear discriminant analysis, and fitness-scaling chaotic artificial bee colony artificial neural network."
81,CS , Computer vision  , Human pose estimation; 3D Shape recovery; 3D Human pose estimation; 3D Reconstruction        ,"3D human pose estimation from a single image is an important problem in computer vision with a number of applications, including action recognition and scene understanding. However, it is still challenging due to its ill-posedness and complex non-rigid shape variations of a human body. In this paper, we use the Procrustean normal distribution mixture model as a 3D shape prior and propose a model transformation method for adjusting limb lengths of the 3D shape prior model, by which the proposed method can be applied to a novel test image. Inaccuracies of 2D part detections are handled by selecting from a diverse set of 2D pose candidates considering both the 2D part model and 3D shape model. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs favorably compared with existing methods, despite inaccuracies of 2D part detections and 3D shape ambiguities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

274,CS , Computer vision  , imaging; radiometric calibration; Raspberry Pi camera        ,"A comprehensive radiometric characterization of raw-data format imagery acquired with the Raspberry Pi 3 and V2.1 camera module is presented. The Raspberry Pi is a high-performance single-board computer designed to educate and solve real-world problems. This small computer supports a camera module that uses a Sony IMX219 8 megapixel CMOS sensor. This paper shows that scientific and engineering-grade imagery can be produced with the Raspberry Pi 3 and its V2.1 camera module. Raw imagery is shown to be linear with exposure and gain (ISO), which is essential for scientific and engineering applications. Dark frame, noise, and exposure stability assessments along with flat fielding results, spectral response measurements, and absolute radiometric calibration results are described. This low-cost imaging sensor, when calibrated to produce scientific quality data, can be used in computer vision, biophotonics, remote sensing, astronomy, high dynamic range imaging, and security applications, to name a few.

281,CS , Computer vision  , Autonomous fire suppression; Fire detection; Suppression systems; IR stereovision; Robotics        ,"A computer vision-based autonomous fire suppression system with real-time feedback of fire size and spray direction is presented in this paper. The system has been developed for use in a firefighting robot for close-range, localized fire suppression tasks in enclosed environments. A probabilistic water classification method was developed for segmenting water spray in a pair of IR cameras. Stereo processing was performed to localize points along the spray path for use in yaw and pitch angle estimation. A Golden Section Search with linear least squares optimization was used to determine the optimal pitch angle of the spray position at each sampling time. Kalman filtering was used to remove noise from the angle measurements and obtain a better estimate of the current nozzle orientation. A decision tree was used to determine the correct nozzle positioning mode using image feedback to suppress the fire and accounts for errors in direction, fire size during suppression, and when to adjust the nozzle based on IR feedback. Through implementation of a PI controller, the system is able to correct for unknown disturbances causing erroneous targeting of a localized fire. Experiments are presented with the initial nozzle angled correctly and with forced offsets in the system to set the initial spray position incorrectly in order for the system to correct. Suppression times ranged from 7.2 s to 16.3 s with a standard deviation of 3.9 s and average time of 11.2 s. A total of 12 tests demonstrated performance of the system given a forced offset to the initial nozzle orientation resulting in an error between the spray location and the fire target. Suppression times ranged from 8.1 s to 27.9 s with a mean of 16.9 s and standard deviation of 6.2 s. The proposed system can be implemented on a robotic firefighting platform to autonomously detect a fire, choose a proper manipulation goal and suppress full scale fires given disturbances causing erroneous targeting."
329,CS , Computer vision  , Motion magnification; Phase-based optical flow; Video; Computer vision; Non-contact measurement; System identification; Unscented Kalman filters        ,"A damage detection methodology is proposed by integrating a nonlinear recursive filter and a non-contact computer vision based algorithm to measure structural dynamic responses. A phase-based optical flow algorithm inspired by the motion magnification technique is used to measure structural displacements, and the unscented Kalman filter is used to predict structural properties such as stiffness and damping coefficients. This non-contact displacement measurement methodology does not require an intensive instrumentation process, does not add any additional mass to the structure which may skew measurements, and can measure more signals compared to traditional methods. This measurement methodology still needs improvement as a tool due to its higher noise level relative to traditional accelerometer and laser vibrometer measurements. In order to detect structural damage using measured displacements from video, an unscented Kalman filter is used to remove noise from the displacement measurement and simultaneously detect damage by identifying the current stiffness and damping coefficient values, given a known mass, which are used to detect damage. To validate the proposed damage detection method state-space equations are derived without external excitation input and experimental tests are carried out. The experimental results show reasonable and accurate predictions of the stiffness and damping properties compared to dynamic analysis calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
50,CS , Machine learning  , distribution; endangered species; groundwater; invertebrates; stream; urban development        ,"1. Species distribution modelling can be useful for the conservation of rare and endangered species. Freshwater mussel declines have thinned species ranges producing spatially fragmented distributions across large areas. Spatial fragmentation in combination with a complex life history and heterogeneous environment makes predictive modelling difficult. 2. A machine learning approach (maximum entropy) was used to model occurrences and suitable habitat for the federally endangered dwarf wedgemussel, Alasmidonta heterodon, in Maryland's Coastal Plain catchments. Landscape- scale predictors (e. g. land cover, land use, soil characteristics, geology, flow characteristics, and climate) were used to predict the suitability of individual stream segments for A. heterodon. 3. The best model contained variables at three scales: minimum elevation (segment scale), percentage Tertiary deposits, low intensity development, and woody wetlands (sub- catchment), and percentage low intensity development, pasture/ hay agriculture, and average depth to the water table (catchment). Despite a very small sample size owing to the rarity of A. heterodon, cross- validated prediction accuracy was 91%. 4. Most predicted suitable segments occur in catchments not known to contain A. heterodon, which provides opportunities for new discoveries or population restoration. These model predictions can guide surveys toward the streams with the best chance of containing the species or, alternatively, away from those streams with little chance of containing A. heterodon. 5. Developed reaches had low predicted suitability for A. heterodon in the Coastal Plain. Urban and exurban sprawl continues to modify stream ecosystems in the region, underscoring the need to preserve existing populations and to discover and protect new populations.

136,CS , Machine learning  , 3-D network-on-chip (NoC); discrete optimization; machine-learning; small-world (SW)        ,"A 3-D network-on-chip (NoC) enables the design of high performance and low power many-core chips. Existing 3-D NoCs are inadequate for meeting the ever-increasing performance requirements of many-core processors since they are simple extensions of regular 2-D architectures and they do not fully exploit the advantages provided by 3-D integration. Moreover, the anticipated performance gain of a 3-D NoC-enabled many-core chip may be compromised due to the potential failures of through-silicon-vias that are predominantly used as vertical interconnects in a 3-D IC. To address these problems, we propose a machine-learning-inspired predictive design methodology for energy-efficient and reliable many-core architectures enabled by 3-D integration. We demonstrate that a small-world network-based 3-D NoC (3-D SWNoC) performs significantly better than its 3-D MESH-based counterparts. On average, the 3-D SWNoC shows 35% energy-delay-product improvement over 3-D MESH for the PARSEC and SPLASH2 benchmarks considered in this paper. To improve the reliability of 3-D NoC, we propose a computationally efficient spare-vertical link (sVL) allocation algorithm based on a state-space search formulation. Our results show that the proposed sVL allocation algorithm can significantly improve the reliability as well as the lifetime of 3-D SWNoC."
206,CS , Machine learning  , High dimensionality classification; Distance function; Fractional distance; Local Partial Least Squares        ,"A central idea in distance-based machine learning algorithms such k-nearest neighbors and manifold learning is to choose a set of references, or a neighborhood, based on a distance functions to represent the local structure around a query point and use the local structures as the basis to construct models. Local Partial Least Square (local PLS), which is the result of applying this neighborhood based idea in Partial Least Square (PLS), has been shown to perform very well on the regression of small-sample sized and multicollinearity data, but seldom used in high-dimensionality classification. Furthermore the difference between PLS and local PLS with respect to their optimal intrinsic dimensions is unclear. In this paper we combine local PLS with non-Euclidean distance in order to find out which measures are better suited for high dimensionality classification. Experimental results obtained on 8 UCI and spectroscopy datasets show that the Euclidean distance is not a good distance fiinction for use in local PLS classification, especially in high dimensionality cases; instead Manhattan distance and fractional distance are preferred. Experimental results further show that the optimal intrinsic dimension of local PLS is smaller than that of the standard PLS."
264,CS , Machine learning  , Machine learning; Prediction explanation; Intelligent system; Black-box models; B2B Sales forecasting        ,"A complexity of business dynamics often forces decision-makers to make decisions based on subjective mental models, reflecting their experience. However, research has shown that companies perform better when they apply data-driven decision-making. This creates an incentive to introduce intelligent, data based decision models, which are comprehensive and support the interactive evaluation of decision options necessary for the business environment. Recently, a new general explanation methodology has been proposed, which supports the explanation of state-of-the-art black-box prediction models. Uniform explanations are generated on the level of model/individual instance and support what-if analysis. We present a novel use of this methodology inside an intelligent system in a real-world case of business-to-business (B2B) sales forecasting, a complex task frequently done judgmentally. Users can validate their assumptions with the presented explanations and test their hypotheses using the presented what-if parallel graph representation. The results demonstrate effectiveness and usability of the methodology. A significant advantage of the presented method is the possibility to evaluate seller's actions and to outline general recommendations in sales strategy. This flexibility of the approach and easy-to-follow explanations are suitable for many different applications. Our well-documented real-world case shows how to solve a decision support problem, namely that the best performing black-box models are inaccessible to human interaction and analysis. This could extend the use of the intelligent systems to areas where they were so far neglected due to their insistence on comprehensible models. A separation of the machine learning model selection from model explanation is another significant benefit for expert and intelligent systems. Explanations unconnected to a particular prediction model positively influence acceptance of new and complex models in the business environment through their easy assessment and switching.

306,CS , Machine learning  , Machine learning; Validity index; Cross validation; Dimensionality reduction algorithm        ,"A critical aspect of dimensionality reduction is to assess the quality of selected (or produced) feature subsets properly. Feature subset assessment in machine learning refers to split a given feature subset into a training set, which is used to estimate the parameters of a classification model, and a test set used to estimate the predictive performance of the model. Then, averaging the results of multiple splitting (i.e., Cross-Validation, CV) is commonly used to decrease the variance of the estimator. But in practice, CV scheme is very computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a new statistics index method called LW-index for evaluation of feature subset and dimensionality reduction algorithms in general. The proposed method is a type of ""classical statistics"" approach that uses the feature subset to compute an empirical estimate of the quality of feature subset. A large number of performance comparisons with the machine learning approach conducted on fourteen benchmark collections show that the proposed LW index is highly correlated with the external indices (i.e., MacroF(1), MicroF(1)) of SVM and Centroid-Based Classifier (CBC) trained by five-fold CV scheme. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that LW index has the same performance as the traditional CV scheme for evaluating the dimensionality reduction algorithms and it is more efficient than the traditional methodology. Therefore, one contribution of this paper is to present an alternative methodology, based on an internal index typically used in the unsupervised learning context, that is computationally cheaper than the traditional CV methodology. Another contribution is to propose a new internal index that behaves better than other similar indices widely used in clustering and shows high correlation with the results obtained by the traditional methodology.

73,CS , network security  , bitcoin; mining; cost of transaction        ,"2008 is the year of creation of the Bitcoin network consisting of a decentralized database, which is storing all transactions of bitcoin tokens, whose quantity is predetermined by a protocol and independent of any authority. The aim of this article is to describe the limits in the use of Bitcoin as medium of exchange. Bitcoin network operation is carried out at high costs of electrical energy consumption, which, will over time be reflected in the price of transactions. Low transaction prices, which is one of the main arguments of Bitcoin promoters, are only possible with continuous issuance of new bitcoins to circulation. Bitcoin's - ""prove of work"" - is the most energetically demanding method from all currently existing methods securing cryptoplatforms. Halving mechanism which reduces the rewards of miners create pressure to decrease hash rate, which is a reflection of the rate of network security. The pressure to decrease hash rate is for now overrun by the increasing efficiency of mining devices. The future will therefore probably bring us fundamental questions: What will it mean for Bitcoin network, if the real costs of running the network will be reflected in costs of transaction? How will Bitcoin network be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies, whose operation is carried out at a much lower cost? Will halving mechanism ultimately cause a declined hash rate, and thereby also a reduction in network security?"
98,CS , network security  , 5G; network security; digital signature; proxy signature; chameleon hash        ,"5G mobile networks are promising to offer mobile users unrivaled experiences with infinite networking capability at any period and from anywhere. However, it appears unnecessary and impractical for the customers and servers to be connected permanently in wireless networks because battery life is a bottleneck in such kind of networks. Therefore, the authorized entity needs to delegate its right to others in order to ensure the services available. This paper aims to address the issue of delegating authentication in 5G networks by proposing a new proxy signature scheme with efficient proxy signing operations. Concretely, we present a new and efficient proxy signature algorithm whose unforgeability can be reduced to the well-known discrete logarithm assumption. In the proposal, the original signer delegates his signing right by signing an exposure-free chameleon hash value on the warrant, and the proxy signer can generate a proxy signature on a message only by calculating a chameleon hash collision between the warrant and the message. This approach is computationally cost-effective for the proxy signer. Further analysis of the new scheme demonstrates that it offers the desirable properties of delegation of signing sights.

331,CS , network security  , darknet monitoring system; Internet threat monitoring; localization attack; packet sampling; network security        ,"A darknet monitoring system is developed to grasp malicious activities on the Internet in an early stage and to cope with them. The darknet monitoring system consists of network sensors deployed widely on the Internet. The sensors capture incoming unsolicited packets. A goal of this system analyzes captured malicious packets and provides effective information for protecting good Internet users from malicious activities. To provide effective and reliable information, sensors must be deployed in secret and hidden from outside. On the other hand, attackers intend to detect sensors for evading them. This attempt is known as localization attacks to darknet monitoring systems. If actual location of sensors is revealed to attackers, it is almost impossible to grasp the latest tactics used by attackers. Thus in our previous work, we proposed a packet sampling method, which samples incoming packets based on an attribute of packets sender, to increase a tolerance to a localization attack and to keep a high quality of information publicized by the system. As a result, we almost succeeded to counter from a localization attack, which generates spike on the publicized graph to detect a sensor. However in some cases, proposed sampling method works to attacker's advantage and spikes appear clearly on the graph. Therefore, we propose advanced sampling methods, which sample incoming packets based on multiple attributes of packets sender. In this paper, we present our improved methods and show a promising evaluation result obtained from the simulation."
372,CS , network security  , Network security; DDoS attacks; Flash events; Entropy; Information distance        ,"A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an austere menace to extensively used Internet-based services. The in-time detection of DDoS attacks poses a tough challenge to network security. Revealing a low-rate DDoS (LR-DDoS) attack is comparatively more difficult in modern high speed networks, since it can easily conceal itself due to its similarity with legitimate traffic, and so eluding current anomaly based detection methods. This paper investigates the aptness and impetus of the information theory-based generalized entropy (GE) and generalized information distance (GID) metrics in detecting different types of DDoS attacks. The results of GE and GID metrics are compared with Shannon entropy and other popular information divergence measures. In addition, the feasibility of using these metrics in discriminating a high-rate DDoS (HR-DDoS) attack from a similar looking legitimate flash event (FE) is also verified. We used real and synthetically generated datasets to elucidate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme in detecting different types of DDoS attacks and FEs. The results clearly show that the GE and GID metrics perform well in comparison with other metrics and have reduced false positive rate (FPR). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

A high security communication flow path is not useful when the network path cannot support capacity and reachability requirements. The deployment phase in communication network can facilitate an optimal network path by focusing on both the network performance and the network security at the same time. In this paper, we describe a use case of smart grid application where security, network capacity and reachability needs to be optimal for successful network operation. We explain our proposed balancing approach of the network performance and the network security which can be useful for the optimal smart grid secure system design."

A number of such protocols are proposed, but most of these protocols are inefficient or insecure. Very recently, Li et al. (Wireless Pers Commun 80(2):581-589, 2015) proposed a privacy-aware handover authentication protocol, and claimed their protocol to be more lightweight and secure than existing protocols. However, our analysis identifies that Li et al.'s protocol is insecure against access point impersonation attack. As a remedy, we proposed an improved protocol to fix the security weakness of Li et al.'s protocol. The improved protocol achieves the provable security in the random oracle model against the hardness assumptions of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem. The proposed handover authentication protocol is also formally analyzed with the automated tool ProVerif. The improved protocol not only enhances the security but is more lightweight than other related protocols."

However, there are situations that necessitate simultaneous authentication of multiple tags as well as the verification of their simultaneous physical proximity to the reader. Duels (2004) introduced yoking proof for simultaneous authentication of multiple RFID tags. Several researchers have since then developed variants of yoking proof using both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. Given that the ambient conditions are bound to be very similar for all objects that are in close physical proximity to one another, we critically evaluate the use of various relevant ambient conditions for this purpose. Based on our evaluation, we choose to use tag temperature and develop a variant of yoking proof protocol for simultaneous authentication of multiple tags.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
698,CS , Cryptography  , meminductor; Wien bridge; chaos; coexisting attractor        ,"A meminductor is a new type of memory device. It is of importance to study meminductor model and its application in nonlinear circuit prospectively. For this purpose, we present a novel mathematical model of meminductor, which considers the effects of internal state variable and therefore will be more consistent with future actual meminductor device. By using several operational amplifiers, multipliers, capacitors and resistors, the equivalent circuit of the model is designed for exploring its characteristics. This equivalent circuit can be employed to design meminductor-based application circuits as a meminductor emulator. By employing simulation experiment, we investigate the characteristics of this meminductor driven by sinusoidal excitation. The characteristic curves of current-flux (i-phi), voltage-flux (v-phi), v-rho (internal variable of meminductor) and phi-rho for the meminductor model are given by theoretical analyses and simulations. The curve of current-flux (i-phi) is a pinched hysteretic loop passing through the origin. The area bounding each sub-loop deforms as the frequency varies, and with the increase of frequency, the shape of the pinched hysteretic loop tends to be a straight line, indicating a dependence on frequency for the meminductor. Based on the meminductor model, a meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic oscillator is designed and analyzed. Some dynamical properties, including equilibrium points and the stability, bifurcation and Lyapunov exponent of the oscillator, are investigated in detail by theoretical analyses and simulations. By utilizing Lyapunov spectrum, bifurcation diagram and dynamical map, it is found that the system has periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic states. Furthermore, there exist some complicated nonlinear phenomena for the system, such as constant Lyapunov exponent spectrum and nonlinear amplitude modulation of chaotic signals. Moreover, we also find the nonlinear phenomena of coexisting bifurcation and coexisting attractors, including coexistence of two different chaotic attractors and coexistence of two different periodic attractors. The phenomenon shows that the state of this oscilator is highly sensitive to its initial valuse, not only for chaotic state but also for periodic state, which is called coexistent oscillation in this paper. The basic mechanism and potential applications of the existing attractors are illustrated, which can be used to generate robust pseudo random sequence, or multiplexed pseudo random sequence. Finally, by using the equivalent circuit of the proposed meminducive model, we realize an analog electronic circuit of the meminductive Wien-bridge chaotic system. The results of circuit experiment are displayed by the oscilloscope, which can verify the chaotic characteristics of the oscillator. The oscillator, as a pseudo random signal source, can be used to generate chaotic signals for the applications in chaotic cryptography and secret communications."
832,CS , Cryptography  , 3-D matrix; Shuffling engine; Logistic map; Chaos; Cryptography        ,"A new data encryption scheme is proposed based on the position substitution, shuffling and a diffusion process. The algorithm searches for the position of a text symbol in randomly generated 3-D matrix and subsequently replaces the symbol. The positions in matrix are shuffled in a retraceable manner depending upon the encryption key. Further, the substituted positions are diffused so that all the cipher text get affected even if a single symbol is changed. The system uses a Logistic map for matrix generation and position shuffling. The algorithm also checks the integrity of cipher text by including its parity in encrypted form. As the system includes substitution, permutation and diffusion, high level of cryptographic complexity is achieved in cipher text. The proposed method is key sensitive output cipher text is random in nature and has avalanche effect. The key length chosen is sufficient to resist a brute force attack. The cryptographic model as a whole demonstrate remarkable resistance to statistical attacks which is a key feature. Detailed runtime comparison with different known cryptographic systems is given.

877,CS , Cryptography  , Chaos; S-box; Cryptography        ,"A new method for obtaining random bijective S-boxes based on discrete chaotic map is presented. The proposed method uses a discrete chaotic map based on the composition of permutations. The obtained S-boxes have been tested on the number of criteria, such as bijection, nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, output bits independence criterion, equiprobable input/output XOR distribution and maximum expected linear probability. The results of performance test show that the S-box presented in this paper has good cryptographic properties. The advantage of the proposed method is the possibility to achieve large key space, which makes it suitable for generation of S-boxes for larger values of n. Also, because this method uses discrete chaotic map based on the composition of permutations which has finite space domain, there is no need for discretization of continuous values of chaotic map, so the process of generation of S-boxes is not affected by approximations of any kind."

Camera trapping is a widely applied method to study mammalian biodiversity and is still gaining popularity. It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools. 2. We describe the free and open-source R package camtrapR, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap-based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organization, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualization of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems. 3. The functions provide extensive automation to minimize data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. 4. Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture-recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, for example in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to GIS software, and single-and two-species activity patterns can be visualized. 5. camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data."

The advanced reliability is achieved by eliminating the main reasons that lead to failures; duplicating/backing the main operating systems; and imparting redundant or extended technical capabilities to the transducer design that make it possible to compensate for partial or complete performance loss of the antenna group. It is shown that given such a design approach, it is feasible to achieve technical characteristics that are stipulated for industrial acoustic-emission transducers. Theoretical estimates of transducer reliability are presented that show that a combination of backing of AE registration channels with different versions of their connection gives ample opportunities for governing the reliability of sensors during their usage/service life."

While active and passive cooling equipment and monitoring devices are important, it is the various personnel responsible for executing and writing procedures, designing and operating systems, and investigating problems and helping prevent them who are paramount in establishing and maintaining a ""cold.chain"" for time and temperature sensitive pharmaceutical products (TTSPPs). These professionals must possess the required competencies, knowledge, skills and abilities so they can effectively perform these activities with appropriate levels of expertise. These are complex tasks that require the development of higher cognitive skills that cannot be adequately addressed through professional development opportunities based on simple information delivery and content acquisition. This paper describes two unique learning solutions (one on a bus called the ""wheels course"" and the other online called ""e-learning"") that have been developed by WHO Global Learning Opportunities (WHO/GLO) to provide participants with opportunities not just to learn about cold chain systems or vaccine management, but, rather, to develop high levels of expertise in their respective fields through experiential and authentic learning activities. In these interactive learning environments, participants have opportunities to address real-life situations in contexts similar to what they may face in their own work environments and develop solutions and critical thinking skills they can apply when they return to their jobs. This paper further delineates the managerial and operational vaccine management functions encompassed in these two unique learning environments. The paper also describes the alignment of the objectives addressed in the ""wheels course"" and the e-learning version with effective vaccine management (EVM) criteria as prescribed by WHO. The paper concludes with an example of a real world product developed by course graduates (specifically a decision tree that is now used by some national programmes). These types of products, valuable in their own right, often emerge when learning environments based on authentic learning principles are designed and implemented as they were by WHO/GLO.

However, the effort and cost invested in creating a networking laboratory with physical equipment are significantly high, especially if the students are to work on realistic scenarios. By substituting physical networking devices by virtualized ones, virtualization technologies may contribute to simplify the laboratory management tasks and allow the creation of affordable and more complex network scenarios. In this way, students can work and experiment on realistic network scenarios, so that their learning experience is greatly improved. In this paper a detailed description of a virtualization-based networking laboratory model, evolved over the last 10 years of authors experience in teaching computer networking, is provided. This laboratory model is implemented using Virtual Networks over linuX (VNX), an open source tool specifically designed and developed to define, build, deploy and manage networking scenarios taking full advantage of virtualization, and supporting hybrid virtual/physical scenarios and heterogeneous operating systems. The features of the VNX tool, illustrated with an example of a complex network scenario used by more than 300 students, are described.

The target and virtual limb, rendered with computer graphics, were shown on the display. Movements of the virtual limb were synchronized with those of the subject. Healthy subjects reached for targets with their dominant arm, and cerebrovascular accident patients used their paretic arm. A polarized display and polarized glasses were used when the subjects were shown three-dimensional images. In the present study, jerk cost was used to quantify the smoothness of movement. [Results] Six of the 10 healthy subjects had significantly smoother reaching movements when viewing the three-dimensional images. The two cerebrovascular accident patients tended to have smoother movements in response to the three-dimensional images. [Conclusion] Analysis of the smoothness of movement was able to detect the influence of the depth cue in vision on movement quantitatively for the healthy subjects and cerebrovascular accident patients."

It is a fundamental process in different applications such as shape reconstruction in reverse engineering, 3D models retrieval, and CAD/CAM applications, etc. It consists of subdividing a polygonal surface into patches of uniform properties either from a geometrical point of view or from a perceptual/semantic point of view. In this paper, unsupervised clustering techniques for the 3D mesh segmentation problem are introduced. The K-means and the Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering techniques are selected for the development of the proposed clustering-based 3D mesh segmentation techniques. Since the mesh faces are considered the main element, the clustering technique is applied to the dual mesh. The 3D Euclidean distance is used as the distance measure to compute matching between mesh elements. Based on empirical results on a benchmark dataset of 3D mesh models, the FCM-based mesh segmentation technique outperforms the K-means-based one in terms of accuracy and consistency with human segmentations."

Hence, efficient model-based perceptual metrics, operating on the geometry of the meshes being compared, have been recently introduced to control and predict these visual artifacts. However, since the 3D models are ultimately visualized on 2D screens, it seems legitimate to use images of the models (i.e., snapshots from different viewpoints) to evaluate their visual fidelity. In this work we investigate the use of image metrics to assess the visual quality of 3D models. For this goal, we conduct a wide-ranging study involving several 2D metrics, rendering algorithms, lighting conditions and pooling algorithms, as well as several mean opinion score databases. The collected data allow (1) to determine the best set of parameters to use for this image-based quality assessment approach and (2) to compare this approach to the best performing model-based metrics and determine for which use-case they are respectively adapted. We conclude by exploring several applications that illustrate the benefits of image-based quality assessment."

The lateral shape of these 2D materials is typically considered random and irregular, and their average size is often estimated using techniques characterized by strong approximations or poor statistical significance. Here we measure in a quantitative, objective way the size and shape of 2D monoatomic nanosheets using a combination of optical, electronic and scanning probe techniques. We measure, one by one, the size and shape of thousands of sheets of graphene oxide as they undergo a standard ultrasonication treatment. Using automatic image processing and statistical modelling we identify two different fragmentation processes in 2D at the nanoscale, related to two populations of nanosheets described by gamma and exponential size distributions respectively. The two populations of sheets coexist during the fragmentation process, each one retaining its average size and shape. Our results explain the size reduction commonly observed in nanosheets upon sonication as an effect of changes in the respective weights of the two populations of nanosheets present in the material."

The watermark has been embedded in intermediate significant bit planes besides the least significant bit plane at the address locations determined by pseudorandom address vector (PAV). The watermark embedding using PAV makes it difficult for an adversary to locate the watermark and hence adds to security of the system. The scheme has been evaluated to ascertain the spatial locations that are robust to various image processing and geometric attacks JPEG compression, additive white Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, filtering and rotation. The experimental results obtained, reveal an interesting fact, that, for all the above mentioned attacks, other than rotation, higher the bit plane in which watermark is embedded more robust the system. Further, the perceptual quality of the watermarked images obtained in the proposed system has been compared with some state-of-art watermarking techniques. The proposed technique outperforms the techniques under comparison, even if compared with the worst case peak signal-to-noise ratio obtained in our scheme."
228,CS , Image processing  , Non-destructive; Inline; Horticultural product; X-ray; Shape model        ,"A combination of 3-D vision and X-ray radiography is proposed to enable low-cost, generally applicable online inspection of internal quality of horticultural and potentially other products. The underlying concept assumes that the shape of the product is known beforehand through a deformable shape model. A 3-D vision system is used in combination with the shape model to accurately determine the complete outer surface shape of the sample. This shape is voxelized to generate a reference product from which a X-ray radiograph is simulated to be compared with a measured radiograph, hence revealing the presence of any defects or disorders. Advantages of this method are that small deviations in internal density are detected easily since the cumulative information of the bulk object shape is removed. Furthermore, no specific detection algorithms have to be developed for different types of defects, since the method will directly identify deviations from the ideal. Validation on two datasets and comparison with two reference detections methods (classical image processing and a human operator) shows that the proposed method reliably (accuracy >99%) detect defects larger than 3.5 mm radius with densities differences between sample and defects as small as 10%. Voids are reliably (accuracy >99%) detected down to a radius of 1.5 mm, corresponding to a volume of less than 0.02 cm(3). (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved."

Then, an interactive node fine tuning method Interactive Marching Nodes was proposed, so the model can be optimized according to requirements of users. Finally, realistic lesion model was generated through texture mapping.

Noninvasive in situ micro X-ray computed tomography (XCT) with a custom fuel cell fixture is utilized to track the same cathode catalyst layer domain throughout various degradation times from beginning-of-life (BOL) to end-of-life (EOL). With this unique approach, new information regarding damage features and trends are revealed, including crack propagation and catalyst layer thinning being quantified by means of image processing and analysis methods. Degradation heterogeneities as a result of local environmental variations under land and channel are also explored, with a higher structural degradation rate under channels being observed. Density and compositional changes resulting from carbon corrosion and catalyst layer collapse and thinning are observed by changes in relative X-ray attenuation from BOL to EOL, which also indicate possible vulnerable regions where crack initiation and propagation may occur. Electrochemical diagnostics and morphological features observed by micro-XCT are correlated by additionally collecting effective catalyst surface area, double layer capacitance, and polarization curves prior to imaging at various stages of degradation.

80,CS , Parallel computing  , Marine electromagnetic geophysics; Finite element modeling; Parallel computing        ,"3D finite-element (FE) mesh generation is a major hurdle for marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) modeling. In this paper, we present a FE discretization operator (FEDO) that automatically converts a 3D finite difference (FD) model into reliable and efficient tetrahedral FE meshes for CSEM modeling. FEDO sets up wireframes of a background seabed model that precisely honors the seafloor topography. The wireframes are then partitioned into multiple regions. Outer regions of the wireframes are discretized with coarse tetrahedral elements whose maximum size is as large as a skin depth of the regions. We demonstrate that such coarse meshes can produce accurate FE solutions because numerical dispersion errors of tetrahedral meshes do not accumulate but oscillates. In contrast, central regions of the wireframes are discretized with fine tetrahedral elements to describe complex geology in detail. The conductivity distribution is mapped from FD to FE meshes in a volume-averaged sense. To avoid excessive mesh refinement around receivers, we introduce an effective receiver size. Major advantages of FEDO are summarized as follow. First, FEDO automatically generates reliable and economic tetrahedral FE meshes without adaptive meshing or interactive CAD workflows. Second, FEDO produces FE meshes that precisely honor the boundaries of the seafloor topography. Third, FEDO derives multiple sets of FE meshes from a given FD model. Each FE mesh is optimized for a different set of sources and receivers and is fed to a subgroup of processors on a parallel computer. This divide and conquer approach improves the parallel scalability of the FE solution. Both accuracy and effectiveness of FEDO are demonstrated with various CSEM examples."

The class of interest in this article is that of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. For this class a behavioural theory has already been developed by Blass and Gurevich, which unfortunately, though mathematically correct, fails to be convincing, as it is not intuitively clear that the postulates really capture the essence of (synchronous) parallel algorithms. In this article we present a much simpler (and presumably more convincing) set of four postulates for (synchronous) parallel algorithms, which are rather close to those used in Gurevich's celebrated sequential ASM thesis, i.e. the behavioural theory of sequential algorithms. The key difference is made by an extension of the bounded exploration postulate using multiset comprehension terms instead of ground terms formulated over the signature of the states. in addition, all implicit assumptions are made explicit, which amounts to considering states of a parallel algorithm to be represented by meta-finite first order structures. The article first provides the necessary evidence that the axiomatization presented in this article characterizes indeed the whole class of (synchronous) parallel algorithms, then formally proves that parallel algorithms are captured by Abstract State Machines (ASMs). The proof requires some recourse to methods from finite model theory, by means of which it can be shown that if a critical tuple defines an update in some update set, then also every bther tuple that is logically indistinguishable defines an update in that update set.

The lake flow pattern is modelled in FLUENT. The parallelization aims at multiple FLUENT instance runs, which is different from the FLUENT internal parallel solver. This approach: (1) proposes lake flow pattern metrics, i.e. weighted average water flow velocity, water volume percentage of low flow velocity, and variance of flow velocity, (2) defines user defined functions for boundary setting, objective and constraints calculation, and (3) parallels the execution of multiple FLUENT instances runs to significantly reduce the optimization wall-clock time.

273,CS , Relational databases  , Knowledge base; Information extraction; Dom tree; Web data        ,"A comprehensive ontology can ease the discovery, maintenance and popularization of knowledge in many domains. As a means to enhance existing ontologies, attribute extraction has attracted tremendous research attentions. However, most existing attribute extraction techniques focus on exploring a single type of sources, such as structured (e.g., relational databases), semi-structured (e.g., Extensible Markup Language (XML)) or unstructured sources (e.g., Web texts, images), which leads to the poor coverage of knowledge bases (KBs). This paper presents a framework for ontology augmentation by extracting attributes from four types of sources, namely existing knowledge bases (KBs), query stream, Web texts, and Document Object Model (DOM) trees. In particular, we use query stream and two major KBs, DBpedia and Freebase, to seed the attribute extraction from Web texts and DOM trees. We specially focus on exploring the extraction technique from DOM trees, which is rarely studied in previous works. Algorithms and a series of filters are developed. Experiments show the capability of our approach in augmenting existing KB ontology."
317,CS , Relational databases  , Data fusion; Order relation; Relational databases; Knowledge base construction        ,"A crucial operation in the maintenance of data quality in relational databases is to remove tuples that mutually describe the same entity (i.e., duplicate tuples) and to replace them with a tuple that minimizes information loss. A function that combines multiple tuples into one is called a fusion function. In this paper, we investigate fusion functions for attributes of which the values can be sorted by means of an order relation that reflects a notion of generality. It is shown that providing such an order relation a priori, let alone keeping it up-to-date, is a costly operation. Therefore, the Dynamical Order Construction (DOC) algorithm is proposed that constructs an order relation in an automated fashion upon inspecting the data that need to be fused. Such order relations can be immediately deployed in a framework of selectional fusion functions, which are fusion functions that adopt the sort-and-select principle. These fusion functions are investigated closely in terms of their selection strategies. An experimental evaluation of our method shows the influence of the parameters and the benefit with respect to using a fixed and predefined taxonomy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

More precisely, our proposal is to automatically create ontology-based virtual learning environments. Thus, to impart relevant learning materials to the virtual LS, we propose the use of ontologies to represent the key concepts and semantic relations in an user- and machine-understandable format. These concepts together with the data (extracted from the real documents) stored in a digital storage format (XML datasets, relational databases, etc.) are displayed in an ontology-based learning space that enables the visitors to use the available features and tools to learn about a specific domain. According to the approach here discussed, each desired virtual LS must be specified rigorously through a domain specific language (DSL) that was designed and implemented. To validate the proposed architecture, three case studies will be used as instances of CaVa architecture. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."

This paper advocates unification of best of breed activities from these methodologies and examines two existing approaches for unifying access to them. It proposes an alternative approach that focusses on the use of domain knowledge through ontologies as offering the best potential for unifying access to them. The reliance on ontologies will provide flexibility in the process and workproducts use within the methodology. The focus on domain knowledge will reduce the number of mandatory methodological tasks and at the same time create scope for reuse with respect to both system designs and components. The paper will further sketch and argue for a full software development lifecycle for MAS where ontologies expressing domain knowledge are the central artifacts.

We implemented three search-based software engineering algorithms, i.e. multiobjective genetic algorithm, multiobjective particle swarm algorithm (MOPSO), and elicit nondominated sorting evolutionary strategy. Twelve experiments to optimize the resource allocation are performed on a published case study. The experimental results are analyzed and compared in the form of Pareto fronts, average Pareto fronts, percent increase in resource utilization, percent decrease in project cost, and percent decrease in project duration. The experimental results show that MOPSO is the best technique for resource optimization because after optimization with MOPSO, resource utilization is increased and the project cost and duration are reduced."

A feature model is a variability modeling artifact which represents differences among software products with respect to variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by selecting features in the feature model (referred to as the configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. However, feature model configuration can be a cumbersome task because: 1) feature models may consist of a large number of features, which are hard to comprehend and maintain; and 2) many factors including technical limitations, implementation costs, stakeholders' requirements and expectations must be considered in the configuration process. Recognizing these issues, a significant amount of research efforts has been dedicated to different aspects of feature model configuration such as automating the configuration process. Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the feature model configuration challenges through applying visualization and interaction techniques. However, there have been limited empirical insights available into the impact of visualization and interaction techniques on the feature model configuration process. In this paper, we present a set of visualization and interaction interventions for representing and configuring feature models, which are then empirically validated to measure the impact of the proposed interventions. An empirical study was conducted by following the principles of control experiments in software engineering and by applying the well-known software quality standard ISO 9126 to operationalize the variables investigated in the experiment. The results of the empirical study revealed that the employed visualization and interaction interventions significantly improved completion time of comprehension and changing of the feature model configuration. Additionally, according to results, the proposed interventions are easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for the participants."

In her seminal paper, Cohen [8, JACM 2000] introduced the notion of hopsets in the context of parallel computation of approximate shortest paths, and since then it has found numerous applications in various other settings, such as dynamic graph algorithms, distributed computing, and the streaming model. Cohen [8] devised efficient algorithms for constructing hopsets with polylogarithmic in n number of hops. Her constructions remain the state-of-the-art since the publication of her paper in STOC'94, i.e., for more than two decades. In this paper we exhibit the first construction of sparse hopsets with a constant number of hops. We also find efficient algorithms for hopsets in various computational settings, improving the best known constructions. Generally, our hopsets strictly outperform the hopsets of [8], both in terms of their parameters, and in terms of the resources required to construct them.

Reducers have a capacity that limits the sets of inputs they can be assigned. However, individual inputs may vary in terms of size. We consider, for the first time, mapping schemas where input sizes are part of the considerations and restrictions. One of the significant parameters to optimize in any MapReduce job is communication cost between the map and reduce phases. The communication cost can be optimized by minimizing the number of copies of inputs sent to the reducers. The communication cost is closely related to the number of reducers of constrained capacity that are used to accommodate appropriately the inputs, so that the requirement of how the inputs must meet in a reducer is satisfied. In this work, we consider a family of problems where it is required that each input meets with each other input in at least one reducer. We also consider a slightly different family of problems in which each input of a list, X, is required to meet each input of another list, Y, in at least one reducer. We prove that finding an optimal mapping schema for these families of problems is NP-hard, and present a bin-packing-based approximation algorithm for finding a near optimal mapping schema."

We seek to address this challenge by exploiting empirically-observed properties demonstrated by graphs that are generated by human activity. In this paper, we propose three space-efficient adjacency list representations that can be applied to any distributed graph processing system. Our suggested compact representations reduce respective memory requirements for accommodating the graph elements up to 5 times if compared with state-of-the-art methods. At the same time, our memory-optimized methods retain the efficiency of uncompressed structures and enable the execution of algorithms for large scale graphs in settings where contemporary alternative structures fail due to memory errors."

A universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to wait-free implement any object defined by a sequential specification. Herlihy's paper shows that the basic system model, which supports only atomic read/write registers, has to be enriched with consensus objects to allow the design of universal constructions. The generalized notion of a k -universal construction has been recently introduced by Gafni and Guerraoui (Proceedings of 22nd international conference on concurrency theory (CONCUR'11), Springer LNCS 6901, pp 17-27, 2011). A k-universal construction is an algorithm that can be used to simultaneously implement k objects (instead of just one object), with the guarantee that at least one of the k constructed objects progresses forever. While Herlihy's universal construction relies on atomic registers and consensus objects, a k-universal construction relies on atomic registers and k-simultaneous consensus objects (which are wait-free equivalent to k-set agreement objects in the read/write system model). This paper significantly extends the universality results introduced by Herlihy and Gafni-Guerraoui. In particular, we present a k-universal construction which satisfies the following five desired properties, which are not satisfied by the previous k-universal construction: (1) among the k objects that are constructed, at least objects (and not just one) are guaranteed to progress forever; (2) the progress condition for processes is wait-freedom, which means that each correct process executes an infinite number of operations on each object that progresses forever; (3) if any of the k constructed objects stops progressing, all its copies (one at each process) stop in the same state; (4) the proposed construction is contention-aware, in the sense that it uses only read/write registers in the absence of contention; and (5) it is generous with respect to the obstruction-freedom progress condition, which means that each process is able to complete any one of its pending operations on the k objects if all the other processes hold still long enough. The proposed construction, which is based on new design principles, is called a -universal construction. It uses a natural extension of k-simultaneous consensus objects, called -simultaneous consensus objects (-SC). Together with atomic registers, -SC objects are shown to be necessary and sufficient for building a -universal construction, and, in that sense, -SC objects are -."

However, previous to this work, there was no generalizable system in place for the structured storage and retrieval of phenotypic information for bacteria. Results: The Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP) has been created to standardize the capture of such phenotypic information from microbes. OMP has been built on the foundations of the Basic Formal Ontology and the Phenotype and Trait Ontology. Terms have logical definitions that can facilitate computational searching of phenotypes and their associated genes. OMP can be accessed via a wiki page as well as downloaded from SourceForge. Initial annotations with OMP are being made for Escherichia coli using a wiki- based annotation capture system. New OMP terms are being concurrently developed as annotation proceeds. Conclusions: We anticipate that diverse groups studying microbial genetics and associated phenotypes will employ OMP for standardizing microbial phenotype annotation, much as the Gene Ontology has standardized gene product annotation. The resulting OMP resource and associated annotations will facilitate prediction of phenotypes for unknown genes and result in new experimental characterization of phenotypes and functions."

Comparing up-to-date ecological and biological findings with historical statements has become a major part of scientific work in the field of ecology. This evaluation and comparison procedure is very time-consuming while the availability of raw data is very low. Comparisons between original findings if available require a lot of work from print publication to digitalization or transformation to appropriate data formats. The effective use of working capacity is a general issue and has become important, should the use of information technologies be invoked to minimize time-wasting copy and paste operations. In this paper we aim to present a working repository for terrestrial biological data. The implementation of this type of data repository will provide various services to participating scientists as long as the final aim is the publication of these repositories. Furthermore, the security and long-term availability of environmental data is an issue of increasing importance to the scientific community. Unrepeatable sampling events and any data thus obtained are precious in time series analysis. For this reason, a well-structured storage of data is necessary for easy accessibility, retrieval and comparability. This is an important issue for the community of environmental scientists. The need to construct and implement repositories should prevail against all hitches and we are therefore describing our on-going task with the primary population of this kind of data repository. A biological and ecological information system is a matter of public interest and should also be a key issue for ecologists. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved."
10854,CS , Structured Storage  , allocation strategies; energy-aware systems; file organization; secondary storage        ,"Collaborative applications with energy and low-delay constraints are emerging in various networked embedded systems like wireless sensor networks and multimedia terminals. Conventional energy-aware task allocation schemes developed for collaborative applications only concentrated on energy saving when making allocation decisions. Consequently, the length of the schedules generated by such allocation schemes could be very long, which is unfavorable or, in some situations, even not tolerated. To remedy this problem, we developed a novel task allocation strategy called BEATA ( Balanced Energy-Aware Task Allocation) for collaborative applications running on heterogeneous networked embedded systems. The BEATA algorithm aims at blending an energy-delay efficiency scheme with task allocations, thereby making the best trade-offs between energy savings and schedule lengths. In addition, we introduce the concept of an energy-adaptive window, which is a critical parameter in the BEATA strategy. By fine-tuning the size of the energy-adaptive window, users can readily customize BEATA to meet their specific energy-delay trade-off needs imposed by applications. Furthermore, we built a mathematical model for approximating energy consumption caused by both computation and communication activities. Experimental results show that BEATA significantly improves the performance of embedded systems in terms of energy saving and schedule length over existing allocation schemes."

Data files are extensible, hierarchically organized and integrated in the Windows shell by using the Structured Storage technology. Data transfers to and from other programs are facilitated by implementing the ActiveX Automation standard and distributed COM (DCOM). ActiveX Scripting allows experimenters to write their own event-driven acquisition and analysis programs in the VBScript language from within e-Phys. Scripts can reuse components available from other programs on other machines to create distributed meta-applications.

For such a system, via the Hirota method and symbolic computation, linear forms, one-, two-and N-soliton solutions are obtained. Asymptotic analysis is conducted and suggests that the interaction between the two solitons is elastic. Bright solitons are obtained for the fields E and P, while the dark ones for the field N, with E as the electric field, P as the polarization in the resonant medium induced by the electric field, and N as the population inversion profile of the dopant atoms. Head-on interaction between the bidirectional two solitons and overtaking interaction between the unidirectional two solitons are seen.

Only for a few values of the order of nonlinearity, is it possible to obtain the periodic solution in terms of more common functions. However, for this family of conservative truly nonlinear oscillators we show in this paper that it is possible to obtain the Fourier series expansion of the exact solution, even though this exact solution is unknown. The coefficients of the Fourier series expansion of the exact solution are obtained as an integral expression in which a regularized incomplete Beta function appears. These coefficients are a function of the order of nonlinearity only and are computed numerically. One application of this technique is to compare the amplitudes for the different harmonics of the solution obtained using approximate methods with the exact ones computed numerically as shown in this paper. As an example, the approximate amplitudes obtained via a modified Ritz method are compared with the exact ones computed numerically. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

In this paper, we describe the sampling and stimulation aspects of such a device. We first describe the signal processing algorithms of two unsupervised spike sorting methods. Next, we describe the LFP time-frequency analysis and feature derivation from the two spike sorting methods. Spike sorting includes a novel approach to constructing a dictionary learning algorithm in a Compressed Sensing (CS) framework. We present a joint prediction scheme to determine the class of neural spikes in the dictionary learning framework; and, the second approach is a modified OSort algorithm which is implemented in a distributed system optimized for power efficiency. Furthermore, sorted spikes and time-frequency analysis of LFP signals can be used to generate derived features (including cross-frequency coupling, spike-field coupling). We then show how these derived features can be used in the design and development of novel decode and closed-loop control algorithms that are optimized to apply deep brain stimulation based on a patient's neuropsychiatric state. For the control algorithm, we define the state vector as representative of a patient's impulsivity, avoidance, inhibition, etc. Controller parameters are optimized to apply stimulation based on the state vector's current state as well as its historical values. The overall algorithm and software design for our implantable neural recording and stimulation system uses an innovative, adaptable, and reprogrammable architecture that enables advancement of the state-of-the-art in closed-loop neural control while also meeting the challenges of system power constraints and concurrent development with ongoing scientific research designed to define brain network connectivity and neural network dynamics that vary at the individual patient level and vary over time."

Using Codepourri, we developed a novel crowdsourcing workflow where learners who are visiting an educational website (www.pythontutor.com) collectively create a tutorial by annotating execution steps in a piece of code and then voting on the best annotations. Since there are far more learners than experts, using learners as a crowd is a potentially more scalable way of creating tutorials. Our experiments with 4 expert judges and 101 learners adding 145 raw annotations to two pieces of textbook Python code show the learner crowd's annotations to be accurate, informative, and containing some insights that even experts missed."

A social poster design deals with social issues, which are not instantaneous events where existing in a dynamic society. Therefore, the social poster design has to represent the continuous consequences due to the social incident. On 11 March in 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake hit off the east coast of Japan, caused 15,821 deaths, 3,962 missing, and 5,940 injuries in 20 Japanese prefectures as reported by The National Police Agency of Japan (Dunbar et al., 2011). Though the earthquake, aftershocks and tsunamis ended, it is an unfinished tragedy, due to the continuous exposure of the radioactive contaminated water by the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The highly contaminated water has accumulated on roofs and it keeps flowed into the Pacific Ocean when it rains (McCurry, 2015). This study aims to present the ongoing impact of radioactive materials to our society on a social poster through an animated graphic. The randomly created background patterns within the poster, symbolize the unfinished radioactive leaking and its circulation in our environment. Hence, this poster is a dynamically changing rather than a static graphic poster, much like the continuous changes occurring within the environment, due to the Fukushima event. In the middle, the red solid circle not only reflects the Japanese flag but also symbolizes the contaminated Earth. For the background patterns, I generated the random motion of oblique lines by computer programming using Processing, which is an open source programming language. The randomly generated graphic by Processing, referred to as animated graphic, exhibits the unexpected radioactive exposures due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The red circle represented Japan and the Earth suffered by the ongoing contamination that it was depicted by transparent red that the symbol and the patterns are overlapped and coexist. It should be noted that the printed version of the poster is captured from the digital work, which can be found at https://dl. dropboxusercontent.com/s/ulcosh5 dpm1xw85/index. html? dl= 0 The animated graphic shown in the dynamic poster, informs an audience of the ongoing social issue that the radioactivity which has been leaking into the ocean since the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011.

Given a digraph G, a partially complemented digraph (G) over tilde is a digraph obtained from G by performing a sequence of vertex complement operations on G. Dahlhaus et al. showed that, given an adjacency-list representation of (G) over tilde, depth-first search (DFS) on G can be performed in O(n + (m) over tilde) time, where (m) over tilde is the number of vertices and ill is the number of edges in (G) over tilde. This can be used for finding a depth-first spanning forest and the strongly connected components of the complement of G in time that is linear in the size of G, and Dahlhaus et al. give applications to finding the modular decomposition of an undirected graph that require that some adjacency lists be complemented and others not. To achieve this bound, their algorithm makes use of a somewhat complicated stack-like data structure to simulate the recursion stack, instead of implementing it directly as a recursive algorithm.

This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference data bases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as to unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (800-130000 species) and variation in the completeness of the reference data bases (representing 15-100% of known species). Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased probabilities of taxonomic placement, which means its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels. We conclude that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging and that neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference. A key aim for future research is the completion of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases and making these two types of data compatible."

We set out to investigate whether Rv2125 or Rv2714 can function in proteasome assembly. We solved the crystal structure of Rv2125 at a resolution of 3.0 angstrom, which showed an overall fold similar to that of the PAC2 family proteins that include the archaeal PbaB and the yeast Pba1. However, Rv2125 and Rv2714 formed trimers, whereas PbaB forms tetramers and Pba1 dimerizes with Pba2. We also found that purified Rv2125 and Rv2714 could not bind to M. tuberculosis 20S core particles. Finally, proteomic analysis showed that the levels of known proteasome components and substrate proteins were not affected by disruption of Rv2125 in M. tuberculosis. Our work suggests that Rv2125 does not participate in bacterial proteasome assembly or function. IMPORTANCE Although many bacteria do not encode proteasomes, M. tuberculosis not only uses proteasomes but also has evolved a posttranslational modification system called pupylation to deliver proteins to the proteasome. Proteasomes are essential for M. tuberculosis to cause lethal infections in animals; thus, determining how proteasomes are assembled may help identify new ways to combat tuberculosis. We solved the structure of a predicted proteasome assembly factor, Rv2125, and isolated a genetic Rv2125 mutant of M. tuberculosis. Our structural, biochemical, and genetic studies indicate that Rv2125 and Rv2714 do not function as proteasome assembly chaperones and are unlikely to have roles in proteasome biology in mycobacteria."

The role and its molecular mechanism of miR-15a-5p in lung cancer have not been reported. In this study, we explored the effects of miR-15a-5p overexpression on apoptosis and invasion in lung cancer cells. The mRNA level of miR-15a-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines was determined by real-time PCR. The miR-15a-5p mimic was transiently transfected into lung cancer cells using Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 reagent. Subsequently, the Brdu-ELISA results showed that introduction of miR-15a-5p inhibited cell proliferation. In addition, miR-15a-5p overexpression could also inhibit EMT of A549 and H460 cells. qRT-PCR were used to determined the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and -9) in lung cancer cells. Next, we found that NF-kappa B1 expression was evidently reduced by up-regulation of miR-15a-5p. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the NF-kappa B1 was a potential target gene of miR-15a-5p. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-15a-5p could directly target the 3' UTR of NF-kappa B1. In conclusion, miR15a-5p suppresses proliferation and metastasis in lung cancer cells by down-regulation of NF-kappa B1 and overexpression of miR-15a-5p might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer in the future."

To fabricate thick, large-area electrodes, a particle electrode fabrication method was also introduced. Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and galvanostatic performance measurements were performed to evaluate the particle electrodes. The results show that the particle electrodes exhibit an excellent charge performance despite the electrode material layer being relatively thick and highly porous. The electrochemical reactor contained 20 single cells stacked together with 30 A h of nickel hydroxide and 15 A h of metal hydride as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical tests showed that the stack exhibited a high hydrogen production efficiency with a maximum current efficiency of 95.3% for hydrogen production and a hydrogen evolution amount per unit input electrical energy of 259.1 mL/W h at 0.2 C. At high current densities (2.0 C), a rapid temperature increase was also observed during the charging process, which led to a reduction of the hydrogen production efficiency. Therefore, further design modifications are needed to control heat generation during operation of the device. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

In this assembled sensor device, FePO4 NPs dramatically promoted the electrooxidation of oxygen on the cathode, which helps to accelerate the voltage output from SC-MFC and can provide a powerful guarantee for LEV detection. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to fully characterize the FePO4 NPs. Under the optimized COD condition (3 mM), the LEV with a concentration range of 0.1-1000 pg/L could be detected successfully, and exhibited the excellent linear interval in the concentration range of 0.1-100 pg/L. During this range of concentrations of LEV, a temporary effect on the anode of exoelectrogenic bacterial in less than 10 min could occur, and then came back to the normal. It exhibited a long-term stability, maintaining the stable electricity production for 14 months of continuous running. Besides, the detection mechanism was investigated by quantum chemical calculation using density functional theory (DFT)."

In fact, unlike electricity demand, natural gas demand in the industrial sector has not been well researched. Our paper aims to cover this gap. It analyses electricity and gas consumption patterns by the Spanish manufacturing sector, between 1995 and 2010. A novel and innovative quantitative approach based on, both, homogenous and heterogeneous estimators was used for this purpose. The results of the no-spurious estimations (the Augmented Mean Group Estimator) show that the price elasticity of gas demand is significantly negative and within the -0.44 to -0.48 range. In contrast, the price elasticity of electricity demand is not statistically significant. The income elasticities show the opposite pattern: those of natural gas are not statistically significant, whereas the income elasticities for electricity are statistically significant and within the 0.22 to 0.29 range. Compared to previous findings, our preferred estimation shows some variation regarding price elasticities of natural gas demand. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Steady state current densities predicted by the model have been shown to agree with published experimental thermionic data. Two separate genetic algorithm optimisations have been carried out for both power density and efficiency, in which electrode temperatures and work functions, external circuit resistance and electrode separation were varied. The result of these optimisations were two configurations separately exhibiting a maximum power density of 1.66 W/cm(2), and a Maximum efficiency of 7.69% for parameter ranges applicable to concentrating solar thermal power.

Segmented profiles cover a time window that is less than or equal to 24 h. Simulation results show that Canberra distance outperforms the other distance functions. Results also show that the segmented cluster centres produce more accurate load estimates than daily cluster centres. Higher accuracy estimates were obtained with cluster centres in the range of 16-24 h.

First, Maxwell's equations and Lorentz force law in vacuum are derived as theorems from the conservation principles. Next, new kinds of averaging procedure, transversal and longitudinal, are introduced to deal with the macroscopic media. Electromagnetic field (E, H) and flux density (D, B) are defined as the longitudinal and transversal averages of the corresponding microscopic field. The polarization P and magnetization M defined as P = D-epsilon(0) E, M = B-mu(0) H are given explicit expressions in terms of microscopic electromagnetic structure of the matter.

987,ECE , Lorentz force law  , Linear machine; Force output; Electromagnetic actuator        ,"A novel dual Halbach array is proposed in this paper to increase the output performance of tubular linear machines. The magnetic field distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space is formulated with Bessel functions analytically. Following that, the modeling of force output for linear machines with three-phase windings is carried out based on Lorentz force law. The formula component of force ripple is separated from the analytical expression of total force. It is found that for multi-phase tubular linear machines, the force output and force ripple are not only closely related to the instantaneous position of the mover, but also the starting position. Therefore, the force output of the linear machine is formulated for three typical starting positions as a function of mover positions. The derived models are simulated with respect to the mover's motion. They are also validated with numerical results from finite element calculation. The study shows that an appropriate starting position of the mover helps to improve the output performance of the tubular linear machines. The proposed analytical force model can also be employed to analyze the influence of the structure parameters on the force output of linear machines with similar structures."

Discord was seeded over a century ago when Abraham and Minkowski proposed different forms of electromagnetic momentum density and has since expanded in scope with the gradual introduction of other forms of momentum and force densities. Although degenerate sets of electrodynamic postulates can be fashioned to comply with global energy and momentum conservation, hope remains to isolate a single theory based on detailed comparison between force density predictions and radiation pressure experiments. This comparison is two-fold challenging because there are just a handful of quantitative radiation pressure measurements over the past century and the solutions developed from different postulates, which consist of approximate expressions and inferential deductions, are scattered throughout the literature. For these reasons, it is appropriate to conduct a consolidated and comprehensive re-analysis of past experiments under the assumption that the momentum and energy of light in matter are degenerate. We create a combined electrodynamic/fluid dynamic simulation testbed that uses five historically significant sets of electrodynamic postulates, including those by Abraham and Minkowski, to model radiation pressure under diverse configurations with minimal assumptions. This leads to new interpretations of landmark investigations of light momentum, including the Balazs thought experiment, the Jones-Richards and Jones-Leslie measurements of radiation pressure on submerged mirrors, observations of laser-deformed fluid surfaces, and experiments on optical trapping and tractor beaming of dielectric particles. We discuss the merits and demerits of each set of postulates when compared to available experimental evidence and fundamental conservation laws. Of the five sets of postulates, the Abraham and Einstein-Laub postulates provide the greatest consistency with observations and the most physically plausible descriptions of electrodynamic interactions. Force density predictions made by these two postulates are unique under many conditions and their experimental isolation is potentially within reach."

The main goal of the present investigation is to synchronize two non-identical hyper-chaotic master/slave systems, which are given as the models of the complicated systems, based on the realization of an efficient automated adaptive sliding mode control scheme. In the research presented here, the mentioned systems need to be dealt with through the proposed control scheme, since two non-identical systems are completely synchronized. In one such case, the whole of the chosen states of the master and slave systems should be coincided after a few time steps, as long as the effect of the external disturbance, uncertainty and unknown parameters could truly be ignored. Due to the fact that the investigated hyper-chaotic systems have taken into consideration as the representation of a number of complicated processes under mentioned external disturbance, uncertainty and unknown parameters, the traditional control approaches cannot actually be realized, in satisfactory manners. With this purpose, the proposed control scheme has been designed to cope with synchronization error, in a reasonable amount of time, in order to drive applicable hyper-chaotic systems. Consequently, the performance of the proposed control scheme is considered and verified through the numerical simulations."

The e-textile structure selection methodology for sensor integration was implemented by interviewing with the experts from the fields of textiles and electronics; hence, it was constructed as two-staged methodology including both experimental study and AHP. In this respect, different e-textile structures including transmission lines containing 15 different conductive yarn types with three different weave types were manufactured via weaving technology in the first stage as experimental part of the methodology, and then, in the second stage, the alternatives based on experimental study were evaluated using AHP. The comparisons were made using priority scales assigned by expert team and synthesized to get aggregated global ratings. In conclusion, appropriate e-textile structures based on weaving manufacturing technology for sensor integration were chosen using AHP technique by ranking alternatives."

We demonstrate that under quite general conditions, each window function can be associated with a sigmoidal curve relating the normalised time-dependent memristance to the time integral of the input. Conversely, this explicit relation allows us to derive window functions suitable for the mesoscopic modelling of memristive systems from a variety of well-known sigmoidals. Such sigmoidal curves are defined in terms of measured variables and can thus be extracted from input and output signals of a device and then transformed to its corresponding window. We also introduce a new generalised window function that allows the flexible modelling of asymmetric edge effects in a simple manner. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The full-wave Green's functions for a grounded dielectric substrate problem are used. The interactions between electric current on a microstrip line and magnetic current on a slot are taken into account by introducing two kinds of controlled sources. This generalized PEEC model will be very useful in signal-integrity analysis for multilayered circuits. To validate the generalized model, three numerical examples consisting of microstrip lines and slots on the ground are presented. The results obtained by the proposed generalized PEEC model are compared with those obtained by commercial electromagnetic simulation software and published experimental results.

Sub-space modeling based geometric programming power optimization has been successfully applied to three different op-amps in 0.18 mu m technology. HSPICE simulation results show that sub-space modeling based GP optimization can allow efficient and accurate analog design. Computational effort can be managed to an acceptable level when searching sub-spaces for transistors by using practical constraints. An efficient scheme in dealing with non-convex constraint inherent in Kirchhoff's voltage law is suggested in this paper. By using this scheme, the nonconvex constraint, such as posynomial equality, can be relaxed to a convex constraint without affecting the result."

Furthermore, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and H-2/LQG (Linear Quadratic Gaussian) controllers based on clipped voltage law (CVL) are also used to compare the results obtained by fuzzy controller. This study employs the main objectives of the optimal design that are not only to reduce the seismic responses but also to minimize the total cost of the damper system. A set of Pareto optimal solutions is also conducted with the corresponding results obtained from the optimal surface of Pareto solutions in this study. As a result, decreasing the number of dampers does necessarily increase the efficiency of the system.

240,ECE , System identification  , System identification; model structure; physical models; instrumental variable; closed loop        ,"A common issue with many system identification problems is that the true input to the system is unknown. This paper extends a previously presented indirect modelling framework that deals with identification of systems where the input is partially or fully unknown. In this framework, unknown inputs are eliminated by using additional measurements that directly or indirectly contain information about the unknown inputs. The resulting indirect predictor model is only dependent on known and measured signals and can be used to estimate the desired dynamics or properties. Since the input of the indirect model contains both known inputs and measurements that could all be correlated with the same disturbances as the output, estimation of the indirect model has similar challenges as a closed-loop estimation problem. In fact, due to the generality of the indirect modelling framework, it unifies a number of already existing system identification problems that are contained as special cases. For completeness, the paper is concluded with one method that can be used to estimate the indirect model as well as an experimental verification to show the applicability of the framework."

A Hammerstein system is used to model the controlled process (linear block) and the sticky valve (nonlinear block): five different candidates for the linear block and two different candidates for the nonlinear block are evaluated and compared. Two of the five linear models include a nonstationary disturbance term that is estimated along with the input-to-output model, and these extended models are meant to cope with situations in which significant nonzero mean disturbances affect the collected data. The comparison of the different models and identification methods is carried out thoroughly in three steps: simulation, application to pilot plant data and application to industrial loops. In the first two cases (simulation and pilot plant) the specific source of fault (stiction with/without external disturbances) is known and hence a validation of each candidate can be carried out more easily. Nonetheless, each fault case considered in the previous two steps has been found in the application to a large number of datasets collected from industrial loops, and hence the merits and limitations of each candidate have been confirmed. As a result of this study, extended models are proved to be effective when large, time varying disturbances affect the system, whereas conventional (stationary) noise models are more effective elsewhere.

Dedicated system-identification experiments without feedback control have been carried out to generate data for the development of this model. The data-driven dynamic model, which is both device-specific and scenario-specific, represents the response of the iota profile and beta(N) to the electric field due to induction as well as to the heating and current drive (H&CD) systems during the flat-top phase of an H-mode discharge in DIII-D. The control goal is to use both induction and the H&CD systems to locally regulate the plasma iota profile and beta(N) around particular target values close to the reference state used for system identification. A singular value decomposition (SVD) of the plasma model at steady state is carried out to decouple the system and identify the most relevant control channels. A mixed-sensitivity robust control design problem is formulated based on the dynamic model to synthesize a stabilizing feedback controller without input constraints that minimizes the reference tracking error and rejects external disturbances with minimal control energy. The feedback controller is then augmented with an anti-windup compensator, which keeps the given controller well-behaved in the presence of magnitude constraints in the actuators and leaves the nominal closed-loop system unmodified when no saturation is present. The proposed controller represents one of the first feedback profile controllers integrating magnetic and kinetic variables ever implemented and experimentally tested in DIII-D. The preliminary experimental results presented in this work, although limited in number and constrained by actuator problems and design limitations, as it will be reported, show good progress towards routine current profile control in DIII-D and leave valuable lessons for further advancements in the field.

In the DPSO-LS algorithm, a novel movement modification equation with variable exploration vector is designed to effectively update particles, enabling swarms to cover large areas of search space with large probability and thus the global search ability is enhanced. Moreover, a Gaussian-distribution-based dynamic opposition-based learning strategy is developed to help the pBest jump out local optima. The proposed DPSO-LS can significantly enhance the estimator model accuracy and dynamic performance. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to multiple parameter estimation including the VSI nonlinearities of a PMSM. The performance of DPSO-LS is compared with several existing PSO algorithms, and the comparison results show that the proposed parameters estimation method has better performance in tracking the variation of machine parameters effectively and estimating the VSI nonlinearities under different operation conditions."
426,ECE , System identification  , Unsteady aerodynamics; Lift enhancement; Frequency response; High angles of attack; Leading edge vortex        ,"A frequency response approach is taken to model unsteady aerodynamics resulting from plunging oscillations of an airfoil. The oscillations range covers high angles of attack (up to 65 degrees) and reduced frequencies (up to 0.95) with particular attention to the range of flow nonlinearities over which lift enhancement is observed. Experiments were performed in a wind tunnel on an airfoil section at a Reynolds number of 80,000. Airfoil acceleration and lift force data were used to determine the frequency response functions between the measured unsteady lift and the quasi-steady lift. The results show enhanced lift amplitude over the stall regime at a reduced frequency of 0.7. The flow dynamics associated with this observation were identified from water tunnel experiments. Particular attention is paid to the flow separation and consequent formation and convection of the leading edge vortex.

Specifically, simulations based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) were implemented to evaluate the electrical conductivity (sigma) of CNTs (used as a filler in a polymer matrix) that formed electrical network inside a representative cuboid volume of the sample. A pseudo three-dimensional (3D) percolation model was developed to study the effects of random connectivity of CNTs to one another on the conductivity of nanocomposites. In our approach, both contact and intrinsic resistances were taken into account. The tunneling resistance between CNTs was also taken into account while dealing with single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs). A resistor network recognition method that optimizes connective paths was built using ACO method and conductivity was subsequently computed as a function of CNTs concentration. Then, the shielding effectiveness was computed using the conductivity data. It is remarkable that the calculated SE values as a function of frequency of EM waves at a constant weight percent of CNTs were in agreement with the experimental data for CNT-based nanocomposites reported in literature.

The output of each inverter is programmed to emulate the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator. The virtual oscillators within each controller are implicitly coupled through the physical electrical network. The asymptotic synchronization of the oscillators can be guaranteed by design, and as a result, a stable power system emerges innately with no communication between the inverters. Time-domain switching-level simulation results for a 45-kW microgrid with 33% PV penetration demonstrate the merits of the proposed technique; in particular they show that the load voltage can be maintained between prescribed bounds in spite of variations in incident irradiance and step changes in the load."
462,ECE , Electrical network  , Circuit-field problems; cosimulation; modified nodal analysis; multiple finite-element analysis; strong coupling        ,"A general and systematic formulation based on the finite-element method, modified nodal analysis and multi-field system approach is presented for the analysis of multiple magnetic field systems that are electrically interconnected through circuit networks in the frequency domain. This approach permits simultaneous solution of any number of 2-D Cartesian and axisymmetric problems by considering the electrical terminals of each finite-element model as nonnatural elements of the modified nodal analysis, allowing their systematic incorporation into the global system of equations. This way, arbitrary electrical network topologies can be readily analyzed, where the magnetic systems are no more than simple elements of the circuit system. Moreover, a unified building block is introduced for the 2-D and axisymmetric models, leading to easy computer implementation. The effectiveness of our formulation is tested by determining the electromagnetic behavior of a double-squirrel cage induction motor that is connected to three feeding transformers. A 2-D Cartesian finite-element model is employed for the three-phase motor, whereas an axisymmetric representation is used for each transformer. Hence, four finite-element models are simultaneously solved, which are electrically coupled through circuit elements. Lumped circuit parameters model the end effects of the motor squirrel cage and stator as well as the associated stator feeding circuits. Previous work only considers coupling of Cartesian systems, while our formulation expands the capabilities of quasi-3-D finite-element modeling by systematically coupling 2-D and axisymmetric finite-element models."

Commercially available fluctuating-temperature chambers are large and costly. This poses a challenge to experimental ecologists endeavouring to recreate natural temperature cycles in the laboratory because the large number of commercial chambers required for replicated study designs is prohibitively expensive to purchase, requires a large amount of space and consumes a great deal of energy. 2. We developed and validated a design for economical, programmable fluctuating-temperature chambers based on a relatively small (23 L) commercially manufactured constant temperature chamber ($140US) modified with a customized, user-friendly microcontroller ($15US). 3. Over a 1-week trial, these chambers reliably reproduced a real-world fluctuating (13.1-35.5 degrees C) body temperature regime of an individual frog, with a near-perfect 1 : 1 fit between target and actual temperatures (y = 1.0036x + 0.1366, R-2 = 0.9977, 95% confidence interval for slope = 1.0026, 1.0046). Over 30-day trials, they also reliably produced a simpler daily fluctuating-temperature scheme (sine wave fluctuating between 10 and 25 degrees C each 24 h) and a range of constant temperature regimes. 4. The design is inexpensive and simple to assemble in large numbers, enabling genuine replication of even highly complex, many treatment study designs. For example, it is possible to simultaneously examine in replicate chambers the responses of organisms to constant regimes, regimes that fluctuate following the means experienced by populations and regimes that exactly mimic fluctuations measured over any length of time for particular individuals that differ in behaviour or microhabitat use. These chambers thus vastly expand the pool of resources available for manipulative experiments in thermal biology and ecology."

This involved connecting the power domains of the memory and logic in series, such that the ground of one power domain is connected to the positive supply rail of the other. In this paper, an ARM Cortex-M0+ and its peripherals are powered from 0 V to V-DD, while its 4-kB ROM and the 16-kB SRAM are powered from V-DD to 2 V-DD. Since the memory and logic will, in general, draw different supply currents, the midrail V-DD is provided by an on-chip switched capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR). To allow a direct comparison of voltage stacking with a conventional single supply, it can be turned off by configuring the SCVR to power both the memory and logic from 0 V and V-DD. Turning on voltage stacking results in 96% power conversion efficiency, while the active converter area is reduced by 2.6x. Despite the use of a smaller SCVR, the voltage stacking reduces the supply noise by 3.4 dB and the output voltage drops from 58 to 36 mV."

The CZT detector system is comprised of four CZT modules tiled in a 2x2 array. Each module consists of 256 pixels (16 x 16, 2.4 mm pixels) and features a built-in ASIC and FPGA. A custom digital readout circuit board was designed to interface the four modules with a microcontroller to a data acquisition PC. The system was placed within the bore of a 3 T GE Discovery MR750 and imaging performance of each modality evaluated using both sequential and simultaneous imaging protocols. The mean energy resolution of the gamma camera both inside and outside the MRI is 7.3% at 140 keV. The maximum increase in the integral uniformity was 3% when using a gradient echo MRI sequence while the mean differential uniformity when inside the MRI increased by 1%. Spatial resolution varied in a predictable manner from 2.4 mm FWHM at the collimator face to 6.9 mm at 10 cm from the collimator. Performance of the 3 T GE Discovery MR750 using a 16-channel breast RF coil array was measured with and without the gamma camera present using a gradient echo and spoiled gradient echo imaging sequence. A realistic 99mTc-filled breast-like phantom containing two lesions (30: 1 lesion to background ratio) was used to assess the feasibility of both serial and simultaneous hybrid imaging. Sequential imaging resulted in a reduction in MRI SNR of 70-80% and a further decrease of 93-98% was observed when performing simultaneous MR/scintigraphy imaging, likely a result of RF interference originating from the CZT detector modules and associated analog electronics. Co-registered scintigraphic and MRI images display negligible geometric distortion when imaged with both simultaneous and serial imaging modes, thus indicating the feasibility of combining MBI with breast MRI."

Although sales numbers are increasing, little emphasis has been laid on the recycling of some key components such as power electronics or electric motors. Permanent magnet synchronous motors contain considerable amounts of rare earth elements that cannot be recovered in conventional recycling routes. Although their recycling could have large economic, environmental, and strategic advantages, no industrial recycling for permanent magnets is available in western countries at the moment. Regarding the essential steps, dismantling of electric vehicles as well as the extraction of magnets from the rotors, little has been published before. This paper therefore presents and discusses different recycling approaches for the recycling of NdFeB magnets from (hybrid) electric vehicles.

How and at what spatial scale(s) animals change their movements in relation to their environment is central to several topics in ecology and conservation, including foraging ecology, habitat selection and dispersal. A method (first-passage time analysis, FPT) has recently been proposed to measure changes in movements through the landscape, as an index of search effort at the pertinent spatial scales. This method seems largely applicable to an increasing number of studies using satellite, radio-tracking or global positioning system (GPS), but its limits have not yet been assessed. 2. Here I used several movement simulations to examine the ability of FPT analysis to detect area-restricted search (ARS) according to different changes in movements, different patch structures and tracking accuracy. 3. FPT analysis was able to detect changes in movements when both speed and sinuosity changed, or when the animal reacted to patch boundaries. It was also able to detect ARS within the same path at several spatial scales in patches (nested or not) of different sizes. 4. Tracking accuracy affected the detection of ARS by FPT analysis. With the widely used Argos system, a minimum of 13 locations in effective ARS was necessary to detect this behaviour; seven when velocity filtering was applied. Similarly, spatial error in location affected the estimation of the ARS scale value, but the application of velocity filtering reduced this effect. 5. Comparisons between a real GPS track and pathways simulating the Argos error showed that the time-sampling rate of locations (due to satellite-pass frequency) decreased the probability of detecting ARS at small scales (50% across the whole range of scales. A velocity filter enabled significant reductions in this effect. 6. Synthesis and application. Within limits, FPT analysis is highly suitable for animal movement analysis, either to quantify habitat use, or to determine the scale most relevant for describing an ecological system or factors affecting movement decisions. In anticipation of increasing applications of FPT analysis in applied ecology, I provide recommendations for the use of the technique with several tracking methods."

For such a nonlinear, unstable and uncertain process, designing a control scheme with the ability to reject the effects of disturbances along with a good reference tracking capability is a challenging control engineering problem. In this work, a novel robust sliding mode control technique named as Improved Integral Sliding Mode Control (IISMC) has been presented for uncertain non-isothermal jacketed CSTR process. Moreover, a variety of recently developed sliding mode control techniques such as Classical Integral Sliding Mode Control (CISMC) and Super Twisted Algorithm based Sliding Mode Control (STA-SMC) have also been devised and compared with the proposed approach in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. A Lyapunov based analysis has also been provided to assure the robust stability of the closed loop process. Furthermore, in order to extend the state feedback approach to the output feedback scheme, two robust observers; High Gain Observer (HGO) and Extended High Gain Observer (EHGO), are also designed for the very process. They have also been compared with each other and have been investigated for robust stability using Lyapunov based approach. Finally, an output feedback control scheme using IISMC and EHGO has been presented and its performance has been examined and compared with the IISMC based state feedback approach. The simulation results show that the proposed control scheme effectively rejects the uncertainties and disturbances without leading the process to instability and offers good reference tracking capabilities.

The SFG is derived on the transistor level and the method is primarily useful for the hand analysis and design of small and medium-size SI circuits (e.g. SI filters, decimators, interpolators). Tables of commonly used SI circuits, in which the corresponding SFGs and circuits are given, make the derivation easy and fast. From the SFGs, not only the overall discrete-time transfer function, but also those in-between individual switching phases, are obtainable. With the proposed method it is straightforward to include non-ideal effects, such as finite output resistance of MOS transistors, clock-feedthrough and settling error. The method is also a useful tool for the synthesis of new SI circuits. It is shown that every low-sensitivity switched-capacitor (SC) circuit can be mapped directly into a low-sensitivity SI circuit with a corresponding topology. Examples of transformed SC circuits are given and two new double sampling integrators are introduced. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Many existing algorithms for three-dimensional data points make use of either the 1D cosine transform or both the 2D and 1D cosine transforms. Existing algorithms based on the 1D discrete cosine transform (DCT) apply the separable 1D transform to the data points in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, while those based on 2D and 1D transforms apply the 2D cosine transform for the x-y planes and then the 1D cosine transform in the z direction. The proposed 3D DCT algorithms handle the 3D data points directly and have been shown to be computationally efficient. They involve a 3D decomposition process where a data volume is recursively decomposed in each dimension until unit data cubes are obtained. The algorithms are presented in the form of a signal flow graph which captures the various computations involved. A complexity analysis along with empirical results is included, demonstrating the performance of the proposed direct 3D DCT algorithms. As 3D FCT and IFCT are symmetric and relatively fast, they can be used in any application requiring a real-time symmetric codec, such as video conferencing, online multiparty video games, and three-dimensional graphics rendering."

It is straightforward to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized and the undamped natural frequency and quality factor can be adjusted electronically without changing the values of the passive components. The proposed structure uses the cascade connection of second and/or first order filter sections. Therefore it carries the general advantages of this type of structures. Further, any current ratio transfer function can be shown to be realized by adding a weighted summer without affecting the basic configuration.

Simplification of the antenna coupling equations leads to a second formulation that is compatible with classically-defined antenna scattering parameter matrices.

Systematic formulations of state-space equations as well as a new switch model are presented. The proposed switch model exhibits a natural switching behavior, which is a valuable characteristic for the real-time simulation of power converters, thereby allowing individual treatment of switching devices irrespective of the converter topology. Successful implementations of the proposed switch model on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device are reported, with two alternative approaches: 1) precomputing network equations for all switch state combinations and 2) solving network equations on-chip using the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. A two-level three-phase voltage source converter is implemented using the first approach, with a time step of 80 ns and a switching frequency of 200 kHz. Ideal and nonideal boost converters are also implemented on FPGA using the second approach, with a time step of 75 ns and a switching frequency of 20 kHz.

A nonlinear dynamic model of the system, considered in this investigation, is developed considering all possible effective elements. The model is then adaptively linearized along the prediction horizon using a state-dependent state space representation. In order to improve the performance of the control system as many linearized models as the number of prediction horizons are obtained at each sample time. The optimum results of the previous sample time are utilized for linearization at the current sample time. Subsequently, a linear quadratic objective function with constraints is formulated using the developed governing equations of the plant. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed control approach is validated both in simulation and through real-time experimentation using a constrained highly nonlinear aerodynamic test rig, a twin rotor MIMO system (TRMS).

The model provides an approximation of the behavior of the flow in the wind farm and obtains the wind speed in the vicinity of each wind turbine.

The comparative studies of the FUZZY P+ID and traditional PID controllers were conducted, and the numerical simulation results show that the performance of the proposed FUZZY P+ID controller is superior to that of the PID controller. The proposed FUZZY P+ID controller was implemented in the constant tension towing winch to substitute for the existing PID controller.

In order to improve tracking performance, the outer control system is designed based on optimal preview control theory and is added to the outside of the inner control system. A polynomial trajectory is used as the reference trajectory and is fed to the outer control system. The reference trajectory is modified online to minimize tracking error.

This method allows the fuzzy structure to supplement the conventional control rather than replacing it. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to find the optimal value of the controller gains. Five modeling scenarios for the fuzzy control and two cases of uncertain parameters were considered to validate the model.

The varicap diode interconnected with sharp metal shank via operational amplifier (op-amp) was electrically linked to the corresponding split-type reflectors on a one-port SAW reflective delay line. A 4.3 nH inductor was also placed in between the split-type reflector on one-port SAW reflective delay line and varicap diode to obtain a large linearity and high sensitivity through impedance matching effect. As electrical pulses imitating neural signals were applied to the sharp metal shanks, overall impedance perturbations between the split-type reflector and external varicap diode under reverse bias were observed, giving rise to amplitude changes in the reflection peaks in the time domain depending on the magnitude of the electrical pulses. Good linearity and sensitivity were observed at the amplitude variations in terms of electrical pulses.

235,Psychology  , Prejudice  , attitudes; implicit measures; longitudinal analysis; self-concept; temporal stability        ,"A common assumption about implicit measures is that they reflect early experiences, whereas explicit measures are assumed to reflect recent experiences. This assumption subsumes two distinct hypotheses: (a) Implicit measures are more resistant to situationally induced changes than explicit measures; (b) individual differences on implicit measures are more stable over time than individual differences on explicit measures. Although the first hypothesis has been the subject of numerous studies, the second hypothesis has received relatively little attention. The current research addressed the second hypothesis in two longitudinal studies that compared the temporal stability of individual differences on implicit and explicit measures in three content domains (self-concept, racial attitudes, political attitudes). In both studies, implicit measures showed significantly lower stability over time (weighted average r = .54) than conceptually corresponding explicit measures (weighted average r = .75), despite comparable estimates of internal consistency.

Participants were Italian and immigrant elementary school children. Results showed that extended contact was associated with improved intergroup empathy, which, in turn, was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes, stereotypes and behavioural intentions.

316,Psychology  , Prejudice  , intergroup conflict; identity; stigma; diversity        ,"A crucial element of navigating group conflict is how group members manage stigma imposed on them by other groups. Across three experiments, we propose that group identification is a cause and consequence of self-labeling with stigmatizing group labels, a practice known to reduce stigma. Experiment 1 found that group identification increased self-labeling with a stigmatizing group label. In Experiment 2, individuals who self-labeled with a stigmatizing group label felt more identified with their group, which reduced the label's perceived negativity; they also persisted longer on an in-group helping task, an effect that was partially mediated by group identification. In Experiment 3, observers perceived self-labelers as more identified with their group and as viewing the label less negatively; perceived group identification mediated the relationship. Group identification is a critical component in reappropriating stigmatizing labels and provides insight into how highly identified members can navigate group conflict by negotiating their group's identity."

However, despite highlighting the importance of pro-environmental social norms, such literature has said far less about the processes by which such norms might develop. We present a new approach to conceptualising social norms that focuses on understanding their dynamics within social interaction, by positioning interpersonal confrontation as a potential mechanism of change. We examine the normative dynamics of environmentalism by comparing the costs of interpersonally confronting climate change disregard with those associated with confronting racism. In two experimental studies, we presented participants with scenarios describing a person confronting (versus not confronting) contentious comments in each domain. We identified social costs to interpersonal confrontation of climate change disregard but not racism, as indicated by reduced ratings of perceived warmth of and closeness to the confronter (Study 1), and this effect was mediated by the perceived morality of the issue in question (Study 2). Our findings highlight how wider social constructions of (im)morality around climate change impact upon social interactions in ways that have important implications for processes of social (and ultimately environmental) change.

In spite of increased secularization in American culture and a growing distrust of organized religion, religious involvement, personal religiosity, and spirituality are still viewed as highly desirable characteristics. This study estimates the extent of social desirability biases that affect self-reports of religion and spirituality by utilizing a bogus pipeline procedure. In this procedure, participants are convinced that experimenters can detect disingenuous responses to individual items on questionnaires through the use of physiological measures, although no physiological data are actually collected. If the self-reports of participants in the bogus pipeline condition indicate greater religiosity or spirituality than those in the control condition, self-report bias is indicated. The bogus pipeline procedure has been used in other areas of study to increase veracity of self-reports when social desirability effects are present (such as reporting sexual behaviors or prejudice). The results indicate that social desirability biases influence multiple constructs including religious orientations, religious coping, and daily spiritual experiences. Implications for future research relying on self-reports of religion and spirituality are discussed."

We review experimental findings that show how social factors shape the perception and evaluation of people, behaviour, and socially relevant objects or information. Subsequently, we summarize the generative view of perception within the `Bayesian brain', and show how such a framework can account for the pervasive effects of top-down social knowledge on social cognition.

1238,Psychology  , Social cognition  , Social cognition; Musical improvisation; Interaction; Joint action; Coordination        ,"A recently emerging view in music cognition holds that music is not only social and participatory in its production, but also in its perception, i.e. that music is in fact perceived as the sonic trace of social relations between a group of real or virtual agents. While this view appears compatible with a number of intriguing music cognitive phenomena, such as the links between beat entrainment and prosocial behaviour or between strong musical emotions and empathy, direct evidence is lacking that listeners are at all able to use the acoustic features of a musical interaction to infer the affiliatory or controlling nature of an underlying social intention. We created a novel experimental situation in which we asked expert music improvisers to communicate 5 types of non-musical social intentions, such as being domineering, disdainful or conciliatory, to one another solely using musical interaction. Using a combination of decoding studies, computational and psychoacoustical analyses, we show that both musically-trained and non musically-trained listeners can recognize relational intentions encoded in music, and that this social cognitive ability relies, to a sizeable extent, on the information processing of acoustic cues of temporal and harmonic coordination that are not present in any one of the musicians' channels, but emerge from the dynamics of their interaction. By manipulating these cues in two-channel audio recordings and testing their impact on the social judgements of non-musician observers, we finally establish a causal relationship between the affiliation dimension of social behaviour and musical harmonic coordination on the one hand, and between the control dimension and musical temporal coordination On the other hand. These results provide novel mechanistic insights not only into the social cognition of musical interactions, but also into that of non-verbal interactions as a whole. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Recent studies matched sonic cognitive deficits like strong risk factors for violence with interesting applications in terms of treatment. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of cognitive remediation (CR) and social cognitive training (SCT) in the management of violent and aggressive behaviors in SCZ. Methods: The electronic databases Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect were searched in, using combinations of terms relating to SCZ, CR and violence. Studies were selected and data were extracted using a PRISMA statement. Inclusion criteria were adults with SCZ and a documented collection of disruptive and violent behaviors, for whom researchers had used a CR or SCT program. Results: Eleven studies were identified, two related to non-specific CR intervention and nine to codified CR or SCT programs. Results showed that these programs had a positive impact on the control and reduction of global aggressive attitudes and physical assaults. Therapeutic targets were social cognition and executive functions through the improvement of interpersonal relationships and impulsivity feature respectively. Effectiveness was proved at various stages of the illness, in different types of patients and units, with effects persisting for up to 12 months after interruption of CR. Conclusions are limited by some methodological restrictions. Conclusion: Although current evidences need to be completed with further randomized studies, CR and SCI. appear to be promising approaches in the management of violence in SCZ."

This study focused on highly disadvantaged mothers of preschoolers and compared mothers with histories of perpetrating child neglect (n = 69) to demographically similar mothers without such histories (n = 76). Participants completed measures of unrealistic expectations for children and other adults, social problem-solving in parenting and nonparenting situations, executive functioning (EF), and attributions for children and other adults. As predicted, associations among these measures were found within and across relational domains. Exploratory factor analysis revealed two distinct clusters that distinguished the two groups. The first included measures of expectations and attributions (for both children and other adults) and the second included problem-solving difficulties and EF. When group differences were examined on individual variables, mothers with histories of perpetrating neglect exhibited more unrealistic expectations of children and other adults, more hostile attributions toward children and other adults, and poorer performance on tests of EF than comparisons. Only interpersonal problem-solving (in both parenting and nonparenting situations) failed to differentiate the neglect group from comparisons. In regression analyses, both parenting and nonparenting social cognition and EF contributed significantly to child neglect. These findings provide some support for this cognitive model of parenting risk and suggest widespread disturbances in parenting and nonparenting social cognition and neurocognition, may play a role in child neglect."

The present study examined whether implicit and explicit social-cognitive information processing interact with each other by investigating young children's and adults' use of verbal (i.e., explicit) information to predict others' actions. Employing eye tracking to measure anticipatory eye-movements as a measure of implicit processing, Experiment 1 presented 1.5-, 2.5-, and 3.5-year-old children as well as adults with agents who announced to move to either of two possible targets. The results show that only the 3.5-year-old children and adults, but not the 1.5-and 2.5-year-old children were able to use verbal information to correctly anticipate others' actions. Yet, Experiments 2 and 3 showed that 2.5-year-old children were able to use explicit information to give a correct explicit answer (Experiment 2) and that they were able to use statistical information to anticipate the other's actions (Experiment 3).

Research on this topic, however, has not been systematic or well-integrated. The current review begins to remedy this by integrating the available research on judgeability from the fields of personality perception, nonverbal communication, and social cognition. Specifically, this review summarizes the characteristics that are likely to promote judgeability and explores its potential consequences. A diverse range of characteristics are identified as predictors of judgeability, all relating to three broader categories: psychological adjustment, social status, and socialization. Furthermore, being judgeable has a variety of potential, largely positive, consequences for the target, leaving good targets poised for greater personal and interpersonal well-being. Nevertheless, many questions on this topic remain and it is crucial for this relatively understudied topic to receive more systematic empirical attention."

When imagining another individual, multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contained information about the individual's unique combination of personality traits.

The full effects of video-conferencing on human communication are still being explored. Video-conferencing is presumed to be a somewhat richer form of communication than email and telephone, but not quite as informative as face-to-face communication. This review explores research into the influence of eye contact on communication and how video-conferencing mediates both verbal and non-verbal interactions. Facilitation of eye contact is a challenge that must be addressed so that video-conferencing can approach the rich interactions of face-to-face communication. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It is also unclear whether attractive persons actually display more positive expressivity than unattractive persons (target effects) or whether high or low attractiveness influences expressivity valence judgments (perceiver effects). Experiment 1 demonstrated that adult ratings of attractiveness were predictive of expressivity valence only for high and low attractive females and medium attractive males. Experiment 2 showed that low attractive females actually display more negative expressivity than medium and high attractive females, but there were no target effects for males. Also, attractiveness influenced expressivity valence judgments (perceiver effects) for both females and males. Our findings demonstrate that low attractive females are at a particular disadvantage during social interactions due to their low attractiveness, actual displays of negative expressivity, and perceptions of their negative expressivity.

242,Psychology  , Nonverbal communication  , belief narrative; narrating; nonverbal behaviour; nonverbal communication        ,"A communicative act that involves the presence of two or more persons always involves a nonverbal aspect. The focus of the article is on nonverbal situations as a basis for the evolution of belief narratives. This pre-narrative aspect has not received much attention in narrative research as most analyses are based on texts that already exist in verbalised form. However, on many occasions the basis for a belief narrative is a nonverbal act that has triggered its witness or re-narrator(s) to interpret it within the framework of vernacular belief. Hence, texts that contain a nonverbal part consist of two components: 1) description of a nonverbal occurrence; 2) its meaning/interpretation that is verbalised by the narrator within the framework of a topical belief tradition. By bringing examples from Estonian belief narratives, the author points out some models and patterns that leap to the eye in texts narrating about nonverbal occurrences (e.g. the context of described situations, the types and results of activities described, etc.). As a theoretical basis, works on communication theory and vernacular belief research are used."

We discuss literature on gene environment correlations in the context of social development and draw implications for individuals with autism. The review expands upon genes, behaviors, types of environmental exposure, and exogenous variables relevant to social development in individuals on the autism spectrum, and explains these factors in the context of the conceptual model to provide a more in-depth understanding of how the effects of certain genetic variants can be multiplied by the environment to cause largely phenotypic individual differences. Using the knowledge gathered from gene environment correlations and the multiplier effect, we outline novel intervention directions and implications."

Using a sample of 178 adults, this study sought to identify a series of nonverbal behaviors the research participants perceived to be associated with the communication of imminent violence. Assuming a boxer's stance, invading personal space, clenched hands, and threatening remarks were almost uniformly associated with impending violence. Several other gestures and behaviors were also perceived to be associated with violence to a lesser degree. Behaviors least perceived to be associated with violence were crying, rapid eye blinking, placing hands on hips, and avoiding eye contact. Analyses by sex and race found only minor, and substantively insignificant, differences, suggesting these perceptions may be innate rather than cultural."

Fifty-one preteens spent five days at an overnight nature camp where television, computers and mobile phones were not allowed; this group was compared with school-based matched controls (n = 54) that retained usual media practices. Both groups took pre- and post-tests that required participants to infer emotional states from photographs of facial expressions and videotaped scenes with verbal cues removed. Change scores for the two groups were compared using gender, ethnicity, media use, and age as covariates. After five days interacting face-to-face without the use of any screen-based media, preteens' recognition of nonverbal emotion cues improved significantly more than that of the control group for both facial expressions and videotaped scenes. Implications are that the short-term effects of increased opportunities for social interaction, combined with time away from screen-based media and digital communication tools, improves a preteen's understanding of nonverbal emotional cues.

In Scandinavia, the concept of relational competence is increasingly used to define the teacher's ability to develop 'good' relationships. The overall purpose of this article is to contribute to the field by adopting an interactionist perspective. Drawing chiefly on T. Shibutani, but also on G.H. Mead and T. Scheff, the article aims to: (i) examine how the teacher-student relationship is constructed through nonverbal communication and (ii) discuss the implications regarding teachers' relational competence in situated teaching. A detailed transcript of a classroom episode is interpreted and analysed using Shibutani's concepts. The analysis reveals two parallel relational matrices, one 'conventional' and the other 'interpersonal'. In the concluding section, it is argued that the relationship between the two matrices plays an important role in understanding teachers' relational competence: the relationally competent teacher takes responsibility for his/her own actions, both as an educator in a conventional system and as a fellow being in an interpersonal system. Expressed differently, relational incompetence means overemphasizing one system at the expense of the other."

We extend this logic to suggest that altruistically motivated prosociality - acting in ways that benefit others - is a self-transcending action that may provide meaning in life. Study 1 provided evidence of a relationship between self-reported prosocial behavior and meaning in life, even after statistically controlling for personality traits and self-esteem. Study 2 provided evidence that engaging in a prosocial action, via writing notes of gratitude, increased meaning in life. Study 3 provided evidence that individuals bolster perceptions of prosociality following threats to meaning. Study 4 suggested relationship satisfaction partially mediates the link between prosocial actions and meaning in life. These studies provide initial evidence that prosociality enhances meaning in life."

However, research indicates that managerial interventions aimed at shaping the organizational climate can be difficult to execute. We develop and test a contingency model of intrinsic motivation and job autonomy as moderators of this relationship. We find that the social climate for cooperation better predicts knowledge sharing when employees show low levels of intrinsic motivation and have high levels of job autonomy. This suggests that a cooperative climate and intrinsic motivation are substitutes with respect to their impact on knowledge-sharing behaviors, while climate and job autonomy are complements. We find support for these ideas in data gathered from a sample of 170 employees of a knowledge-intensive firm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

To establish that it is prosocial behavior itself, and not only an increased sense of social relatedness to the recipient that improves well-being, participants (n = 76) were invited to play a simple computer game, where half were made aware of a chance to have an anonymous prosocial impact through gameplay. As compared to the control condition, this group experienced more positive affect, meaningfulness and marginally more vitality. Going beyond self-reported outcomes, they also demonstrated better post-game performance on a subsequent Stroop task, providing behavioral evidence for the positive effects of prosocial behavior. Also supported was the hypothesis that these positive effects of prosocial behavior on well-being were mediated by subjectively assessed autonomy and competence need satisfactions."

Results indicate that even the youngest children (age 3) displayed some altruistic acts; both the number of children showing altruism, and their number of altruistic acts, were greater at each succeeding age level. Sharing was the most common altruistic behavior, and it was more frequent than helping and donation behaviors at earlier ages. Possible explanations for the different developmental trajectories of different altruistic acts are discussed, with emphasis on the differing cognitive and empathic demands of the situation. Main contributions of the study include demonstration of (1) different developmental trajectories for different types of altruistic acts; (2) age-related increase in spontaneous altruistic acts toward peers between 3 and 5 years of age; (2) the utility of a naturalistic, structured observational task to study spontaneous altruism towards peers in young children."

This study focuses on the positive effects of music with prosocial lyrics on people in an everyday setting. Based on the general learning model, a field experiment (N = 256, 66% female) was conducted to test whether people exposed to music with prosocial lyrics engaged in more prosocial behavior by buying more fair trade products compared to regular products than did those exposed to songs with neutral lyrics. Guests of a cafe were randomly assigned to either the prosocial or the neutral music condition and were monitored by two observers who were instructed to report the prosocial purchase (of fair trade coffee) and tipping behavior of the guests. The results indicated that there is a significant positive association between prosocial behavior and the prosocial lyrics of the songs played. The study shows that it is most likely that music with prosocial lyrics can influence one's prosocial purchase behavior in an everyday situation. The underlying mechanisms are still poorly researched, but these findings support the theoretical assumptions."

Wider measures of success - such as citizenship or lifelong learning - influence each other and emerge over time from complex interactions between students, teachers and leaders, and the wider community. Unless methods are found to evaluate these broader outcomes, which are able to do justice to learning and achievement as emergent properties of the learner's engagement with his or her world the education system will continue to focus on narrow measures of school effectiveness which do not properly account for complexity. In this article we describe the rationale and methodology underpinning a pilot research project that applied hierarchical process modelling to a group of schools as complex living systems, using software developed by engineers at the University of Bristol, called Perimeta. The aim was to generate a stakeholder owned systems design which was better able to account for the full range of outcomes valued by each school, and for the complex processes which facilitate or inhibit them, thus providing a more nuanced leadership decision-making analytic. The project involved three academies in the UK."
1606,Psychology  , Leadership  , executive succession; board of directors; upper echelons        ,"A wealth of governance research has examined CEO successions and the negative organizational consequences that arise when boards are unable to effect smooth leadership transitions. Despite those findings, empirical and anecdotal evidence indicates that disruptive successions are still very common. In this article, we investigate whether disruptive CEO successions are viewed as a governance lapse by the board. We focus specifically on succession processes that involve the use of an interim leader. We leverage established research that shows that the pattern of board turnover observed in the wake of negative events is indicative of whether board behaviors are-in practice-viewed as normative violations. We theorize that audiences will disapprove of boards' use of interim CEOs and, therefore, expect that these successions will prompt higher rates of board turnover than those observed following noninterim successions. However, we also anticipate that this relationship will be moderated by situational characteristics (e.g., surprise CEO departure, dynamic industry environment) that complicate succession planning and make audiences more accepting of a board's decision to rely on an interim CEO. Our analysis of 438 successions at publicly traded U.S. firms provides support for these arguments. We discuss the implications of our findings for successions and corporate governance."

For this reason, the project Future Circular Collider (FCC) has started, with the goal of developing a 100-km-circumference collider of 50 TeV proton beams. The Eurocircol collaboration is part of the FCCstudy under the European Community leadership, and it aims to develop a conceptual design of FCC till 2019. One of the main targets is to design a bending dipole able to reach 16 T operation magnetic field, in order to accomplish the size and energy constraints. Such a magnetic field can be reached using Nb3Sn conductors. One option under exploration is the Cos. dipole, by INFN of Milano and Genova. Because of the high stored energy and the large current densities due to the conductor performances, quench protection is one of the most challenging aspects of the design. In this paper, the quench protection of the cos. design is presented. A standard quench protection study is accompanied by a less conservative study which includes ac effects on the power dissipation inside the coils and on the magnet inductance, in order to not exclude preventively more convenient designs, and to develop a more performing magnet as possible."

Design: A kaupapa Mori consistent approach was undertaken. A systematic narrative technique was employed for the qualitative data analysis. Data were triangulated through independent data coding by three researchers (two of whom identified as Mori researchers), to ensure a robust and consistent method of analysis as well as adhering to a kaupapa Mori research approach. Setting/participants: Recruitment of participants was through kaumtua of Te Kupenga Hauora Mori (Mori leadership within the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences), University of Auckland and local Auckland marae. Focus group or individual interviews (as per their preference) were undertaken with 20 Kaumtua from the Auckland region. Results: Five closely interrelated themes were identified from kaumtua narratives regarding physician aid-in dying. These were (1) attitudes and understandings of physician aid-in dying, (2) influence of power, (3) significance of kawa, (4) whnau relationships and the (5) significance of wairua. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that for these kaumtua, medical practices that hasten death such as physician aid-in dying are not all just about the dying'. Tikanga and kawa are important processes and concepts to understand during death and dying, and whnau are central to such processes being respected by those involved in the dying process. These factors are so closely intertwined that they cannot be considered in separation of each other."

The aim was to explore, from the perspective of hospital foodservice staff, their experiences delivering a nutrition intervention and the barriers and enablers to its implementation. MethodsA process evaluation of a pilot study was undertaken using qualitative description. A purposive sample (n = 15) of hospital foodservice supervisors and foodservice assistants responsible for delivering a higher energy menu to hospital patients participated in focus groups and semistructured interviews. Theoretical frameworks of behaviour underpinned the method. Content analysis elicited factors (sub-themes) influencing foodservice staff's capability, opportunity and motivation to provide the nutrition intervention. Thematic analysis (by two independent researchers) further explored factors (themes) related to the process of the intervention's implementation. ResultsFive key themes (and 15 sub-themes) explained factors effecting implementation of the nutrition intervention. Aspects of the foodservice environment and patients' resistance were barriers to implementation and perceived sustainability. Teamwork, problem solving, leadership and job satisfaction were enablers. There was an opportunity to optimise training and feedback. Characteristics of foodservice staff, including their: knowledge, beliefs and perceptions of diet, health and their job role, had the potential to influence their behaviours and decision making. ConclusionsA number of interacting factors influenced foodservice staff's delivery of a higher energy menu as planned. Addressing the challenges of time, foodservice structure, patients' resistance, gaps in knowledge and misconceptions among foodservice staff may enhance similar nutrition interventions in the future."

His mood and binge eating symptoms subsided, but intractable body weight gain only partially improved after treatment. When encountering manifestations of depression with atypical features, especially with binge eating symptoms in male children and adolescents, with early onset age, no family history, and prolonged depressive episodes, clinicians should consider not only mood disorders including bipolar spectrum disorders but also organic brain lesions such as intracranial germinoma."

This paper serves to question the medical metaphors on which treatment has been based, in favour of alternative perspectives that resonate more clearly with the lived experience of those for whom it has failed. We invite the consideration of alternative metaphors, which can disrupt the notion of heroic patients (and therapists), mediate against acts of self-silencing and sensitising us to more radical acts of listening. Beyond the randomised trials and manuals it is time for us to listen to the realities of suffering, the minutiae of resistance and the life that can still be lived."

The present study aimed to experimentally investigate the impact of attractive celebrity and peer images on women's body image. Participants were 138 female undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to view either a set of celebrity images, a set of equally attractive unknown peer images, or a control set of travel images. All images were sourced from public Instagram profiles. Results showed that exposure to celebrity and peer images increased negative mood and body dissatisfaction relative to travel images, with no significant difference between celebrity and peer images. This effect was mediated by state appearance comparison. In addition, celebrity worship moderated an increased effect of celebrity images on body dissatisfaction. It was concluded that exposure to attractive celebrity and peer images can be detrimental to women's body image. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1066,Psychology  , Eating disorders  , Students; Physical activity; Eating disorders; Substance use        ,"A number of previous studies have focused on the effect of sport practice on eating disorders and substance use. Most of these studies suggest that among students sport practice is related to low levels of health issues like eating disorders and substance use. However, there is a relative dearth of evidence for these relationships and previous findings are based on comparisons between people involved in sport practice and physical activity and sedentary or largely inactive people. The present study aims to test the effects of frequency of sport practice on college students' eating disorders and substance use when also controlling for gender effects. Methods. - One thousand and seventy-three first year college students (35.6% boys, 64.4% girls) volunteered to participate in the study. Participants were divided into three groups according to the frequency of their sport practice: students who rarely participated in sport practice (less than one hour a week and not every week; 406 students, 26.4% boys vs 73.6% girls), students who frequently participated in sport practice (every week but less than eight hours a week; 173 students, 33.5% boys vs 66.5% girls), and students who had intensive sport practice (eight hours a week or more; 494 students, 43.9% boys vs 56.1% girls). Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use were assessed using the Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). Three different categories of eating disorders (Dieting, Bulimia, Oral control) were assessed using the EAT -26 inventory. ANOVAs were computed to test for gender differences across the three sport practice groups. Results. - Results of univariate ANOVAs revealed main effects for gender and sport practice on some of the substance use and eating disorder variables, ANOVA with multiple comparisons (Tamhan T Test) revealed a significant interaction effect of sport practice and gender on oral control and tobacco use. For girls, oral control and tobacco use do not vary within the three groups of sport practice whereas for boys the more frequent the sport practice, the lower their scores on oral control and tobacco use. For oral control, boys reported significantly higher scores than girls only when sport practice was rare. For tobacco use, boys reported significantly higher scores than girls when sport practice was rare and lower scores when sport practice was intensive. Conclusion. - These results suggest that the positive effects of sport practice vary by gender and that the campaigns for promotion of physical activity might assist in the prevention of health issues amongst students but should be adapted according to the gender of the participants.

However, the area of the portion sizes could be an unmeasured variable driving the anxiety response. To test the hypothesis that area mediates the effects of energy content on expected anxiety, the same images of portions were measured in area (cm(2)), and standardized values of expected anxiety were regressed from standardized values of energy and area of portions. With regression of expected anxiety from portion size in area, M&Ms, which had the highest energy density of the four foods, elicited the highest expected anxiety slope beta = 1.75), which was significantly different from the expected anxiety slopes of the other three foods (beta range = 0.67 - 0.96). Area was confirmed as a mediator of energy effects from loss of significance of the slopes when area was added to the regression of expected anxiety from energy x food. When expected anxiety was regressed from food, area, energy and area by energy interaction, area accounted for 5.7 times more variance than energy, and beta for area (0.7) was significantly larger (by 0.52, SE = 0.15, t = 3.4, p = 0.0007) than beta for energy (0.19). Area could be a learned cue for the energy content of food portions, and thus, for weight gain potential, which triggers anxiety in patients with anorexia nervosa.

However, little research has prospectively examined how aggression may affect time to onset of hypomanic/manic versus major depressive episodes. In a longitudinal study, we tested the hypothesis that aggression would prospectively predict a shorter time to the onset of hypomanic/manic episodes and a longer time to the onset of major depressive episodes, based on the behavioral approach system theory of BSDs. Young adults (N=120) diagnosed with cyclothymia, bipolar II disorder, or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified were followed every 4 months for an average of 3.55 years. Participants completed measures of depressive and manic symptoms, family history of mood disorder, impulsivity, and aggression at baseline and were followed prospectively with semistructured diagnostic interview assessments of hypomanic/manic and major depressive episodes and treatment seeking for mood problems. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses indicated that overall, physical, and verbal aggression predicted a longer time to major depressive episode onset, even after controlling for baseline depressive and manic symptoms, family history of mood disorder, treatment seeking for mood problems, and impulsivity. Aggression, however, did not significantly predict time to onset of hypomanic/manic episodes, controlling for the same covariates. The findings suggest that approach-related behaviors may be utilized to delay the onset of major depressive episodes among people with BSDs."
607,Psychology  , Depression  , Asthma; Depression; Sleep; Disorders of excessive somnolence        ,"A large number of asthmatic patients, particularly females, present inadequate disease control. Depressive symptoms are reportedly common in asthma and have been related to poor disease control, but the mechanism of this association is still unclear. Poor quality sleep, frequently observed in asthmatics, is also a manifestation of depression and has been related to uncontrolled asthma. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and asthma control. This was a cross-sectional study of 123 women with previous diagnosis of asthma from a reference center in Fortaleza, Brazil. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); quality of sleep was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), daytime sleepiness by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and asthma control by the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Inadequate asthma control (ACT5) in 99 (80.49 %), and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS >= 10) in 34 (27.64 %). Depressive symptoms were associated with both poor quality sleep (R = 0.326) and inadequate asthma control (R = -0.299). Regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms and sleep quality were independent predictors of the level of asthma control. Asthma control in women is independently associated with depressive symptoms and quality of sleep, suggesting that these patients might benefit from simple measures to promote healthy sleep behavior and sleep hygiene and also that routine screening for depression can be relevant, particularly, in poorly controlled cases."

Treated as separate entities for decades, we now appreciate that these events define a continuum of spreading mass depolarizations, a concept that is central to understanding their pathologic effects. Within minutes of acute severe ischemia, the onset of persistent depolarization triggers the breakdown of ion homeostasis and development of cytotoxic edema. These persistent changes are diagnosed as diffusion restriction in magnetic resonance imaging and define the ischemic core. In delayed lesion growth, transient spreading depolarizations arise spontaneously in the ischemic penumbra and induce further persistent depolarization and excitotoxic damage, progressively expanding the ischemic core. The causal role of these waves in lesion development has been proven by real-time monitoring of electrophysiology, blood flow, and cytotoxic edema. The spreading depolarization continuum further applies to other models of acute cortical lesions, suggesting that it is a universal principle of cortical lesion development. These pathophysiologic concepts establish a working hypothesis for translation to human disease, where complex patterns of depolarizations are observed in acute brain injury and appear to mediate and signal ongoing secondary damage."
900,Medical , Depression  , Cortical spreading depolarisation; subarachnoid haemorrhage; stroke; traumatic brain injury; migraine        ,"A new research field in translational neuroscience has opened as a result of the recognition since 2002 that ""spreading depression of Le (a) over tilde $o'' can be detected in many patients with acute brain injury, whether vascular and spontaneous, or traumatic in origin, as well as in those many individuals experiencing the visual (or sensorimotor) aura of migraine. In this review, we trace from their first description in rabbits through to their detection and study in migraine and the injured human brain, and from our personal perspectives, the evolution of understanding of the importance of spread of mass depolarisations in cerebral grey matter. Detection of spontaneous depolarisations occurring and spreading in the periphery or penumbra of experimental focal cortical ischemic lesions and of their adverse effects on the cerebral cortical microcirculation and on the tissue glucose and oxygen pools has led to clearer concepts of how ischaemic and traumatic lesions evolve in the injured human brain, and of how to seek to improve clinical management and outcome. Recognition of the likely fundamental significance of spreading depolarisations for this wide range of serious acute encephalopathies in humans provides a powerful case for a fresh examination of neuroprotection strategies."

A series of quasi-static axial compression experiments were carried out on 2 x 2 thin-walled semi-ellipsoidal shell, the compression deformation and yield behavior of thin wall semi-ellipsoidal shells with different materials, diameters and wall thicknesses were studied by means of ANSYS/LS-DYNA finite element simulation and experiment. Then, the effect of filling mode of epoxy resin on the mechanical properties of Column-cell sandwich composites was studied. The results show that the deformation process of the thin spherical shell can be divided into local flattening, axisymmetric depression, non-axisymmetric depression and compaction stage. As the wall thickness increases, the deformation""mode changes from the polygon to the ring and the deformation process become three stages; small diameter requires larger force under the conditions of the same compression displacement, as the diameter increases, the critical displacement of flipping and asymmetric buckling increases; Epoxy filled in the spherical shell of the sample specific compression performance is better than filled in the outer shell and better than unfilled with epoxy resin.

This disturbance importantly contributes to the severe social consequences of these conditions. The combination of economic game theory and neuroscience opens up the potential to examine dysfunctional social behavior at the computational level, including psychological, social and biological information in the same model. In current studies, we examine social decision-making in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder and autism spectrum disorder using simple social experiments. We found that social decision-making is less consistent in patients with borderline personality disorder than in depressed individuals, patients with autism and controls. Adult patients with autism spectrum disorders showed reduced unconditional altruism in our experiments. Patients with major depressive disorder specifically exhibited competition avoidance. We currently examine the neural substrate of abnormal social decision-making using fMRI."

This indication is supported by data of neurobiological research, as highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) are highly concentrated in neural phospholipids and are important components of the neuronal cell membrane. They modulate the mechanisms of brain cell signaling, including the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. The aim of this review is to provide a complete and updated account of the empirical evidence of the efficacy and safety that are currently available for omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The main evidence for the effectiveness of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been obtained in mood disorders, in particular in the treatment of depressive symptoms in unipolar and bipolar depression. There is some evidence to support the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of conditions characterized by a high level of impulsivity and aggression and borderline personality disorders. In patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, small-to-modest effects of omega-3 HUFAs have been found. The most promising results have been reported by studies using high doses of EPA or the association of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. In schizophrenia, current data are not conclusive and do not allow us either to refuse or support the indication of omega-3 fatty acids. For the remaining psychiatric disturbances, including autism spectrum disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders and substance use disorder, the data are too scarce to draw any conclusion. Concerning tolerability, several studies concluded that omega-3 can be considered safe and well tolerated at doses up to 5 g/day."

The current study extended prior investigations in testing differential function of Borderline diagnostic criteria using both regression and latent-trait methods in the same sample, examining both Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) and DSM-5 alternative model criteria for borderline personality. Data were obtained from a national sample of 337 clinicians providing diagnostic information on 1 of their target patients. Chronic feelings of emptiness was the only criterion that demonstrated consistent evidence of potential differential functioning across methods and diagnostic models.

We did not find differences between BPD patients and healthy women (p = 0.40) concerning hair cortisol levels but increased hair testosterone levels among BPD patients compared to controls (p = 0.03). These results remained when restricting the analyses to unmedicated patients. Our data indicate altered long-term testosterone but not cortisol levels in females with BPD.

Meta-structural approaches have clarified fundamental problems and made substantial gains by using covariance structures to organize the nature of clinical symptom patterns. A remaining task is how to specify the connections between these patterns across behavioral, cognitive, and neural mechanisms. Together, meta-structural approaches and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) offer a means to parse out these connections. I comment on the included articles in this special section on psychopathology meta-structure and argue that core dimensions of psychopathology identified with meta-structural approaches can advance the RDoC initiative and that the RDoC framework, in turn, can strengthen structural approaches by providing an organizational scaffold to elucidate the relations of behavioral, cognitive, and neural mechanisms and to relate them to dimensions of human suffering and dysfunction."

In this context, capital markets are sometimes non-efficient and an anomaly-based trading strategy could be used to enhance the returns, especially in the case of emergent markets. This article analyses the presence of the Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) effect on the Romanian stock market, in a time span that includes calm, growth periods and volatile periods as the one of the 2008 global financial crisis. The results support the existence of a correlation between the number of hours of daylight and market returns before and after the last financial crisis, even if the effect seems to change after the crisis."

These and other biological hypotheses are viewed in the aspect of the current genetic, neurochemical and neuroimaging studies as well as in relation to different treatment approaches. Depression seems not to be a homogenous disease and may be caused by different factors. Genetic factors and stressful life events play an important role in the young age. Chronic stress, chronobiological disturbances and comorbid somatic disease are relevant to middle-aged and elderly people. Moreover, recurrent and chronic depression are accompanied by cognitive impairment, social dysfunction and neurodegeneration. All these factors should be taken into consideration in the development of personalized complex treatment programs."

A consensus meeting involving experts in depressive disorders and their management was held in September 2012. Key areas in treating depression were reviewed and the strength of evidence and clinical implications were considered. The guidelines were then revised after extensive feedback from participants and interested parties. A literature review is provided which identifies the quality of evidence upon which the recommendations are made. These guidelines cover the nature and detection of depressive disorders, acute treatment with antidepressant drugs, choice of drug versus alternative treatment, practical issues in prescribing and management, next-step treatment, relapse prevention, treatment of relapse and stopping treatment. Significant changes since the last guidelines were published in 2008 include the availability of new antidepressant treatment options, improved evidence supporting certain augmentation strategies (drug and non-drug), management of potential long-term side effects, updated guidance for prescribing in elderly and adolescent populations and updated guidance for optimal prescribing. Suggestions for future research priorities are also made."
2092,Psychology  , Seasonal affective disorder  , Biological rhythms; Depression; Animal models        ,"Affective disorders such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder are associated with major disruptions in circadian rhythms. Indeed, altered sleep/wake cycles are a critical feature for diagnosis in the DSM IV and several of the therapies used to treat these disorders have profound effects on rhythm length and stabilization in human populations. Furthermore, multiple human genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in specific circadian genes associated with these disorders. Thus, there appears to be a strong association between the circadian system and mood regulation, although the mechanisms that underlie this association are unclear. Recently, a number of studies in animal models have begun to shed light on the complex interactions between circadian genes and mood-related neurotransmitter systems, the effects of light manipulation on brain circuitry, the impact of chronic stress on rhythms, and the ways in which antidepressant and mood-stabilizing drugs alter the clock. This review will focus on the recent advances that have been gleaned from the use of pre-clinical models to further our understanding of how the circadian system regulates mood.

This meta-analysis aims to summarize an up-to-date report on the efficacy of agomelatine in major depressive disorder. Archives of published results in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were searched for randomized double-blind trials comparing agomelatine against placebo or antidepressant in major depressive disorder. Change in severity of depression as a result of intervention was the main outcome measure. Data necessary to compute the standardized mean difference (SMD) of this outcome and additional sample parameters that were likely to influence the main outcome were extracted for each selected studies. Summary effect sizes of various groups and subgroups were computed from SMDs between agomelatine and control (placebo or antidepressants) arms. There were nine trials involving 3943 severe cases of depression on agomelatine (n=2390) and either placebo (n=689) or antidepressants (n=864). Agomelatine (n=1274) stood superior to placebo (n=689) by a small margin (SMD-0.26, p=3.48x10(-11)) and the superiority of agomelatine (n=834, dose >= 25 mg/d) over antidepressants (paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine; n=864) was even smaller (SMD-0.11, p=0.02). Although there is evidence of the superiority of agomelatine over placebo and selected antidepressants, it is questionable whether the magnitude of effect size is clinically significant and sample characteristics are relevant to the general patient population with major depressive disorder."
1239,Psychology  , Schizophrenia  , attention; event-related potential; hyperfocusing; p300; schizophrenia        ,"A recently proposed hyperfocusing hypothesis of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia proposes that people with schizophrenia (PSZ) tend to concentrate processing resources more narrowly but more intensely than healthy control subjects (HCS). The present study tests a key prediction of this hypothesis, namely, that PSZ will hyperfocus on information presented at the center of gaze. This should lead to greater filtering of peripheral stimuli when the task requires focusing centrally but reduced filtering of central stimuli when the task requires attending broadly in the periphery. These predictions were tested in a double oddball paradigm, in which frequent standard stimuli and rare oddball stimuli were presented at central and peripheral locations while event-related potentials were recorded. Participants were instructed to discriminate between the standard and oddball stimuli at either the central location or at the peripheral locations. PSZ and HCS showed opposite patterns of spatial bias at the level of early sensory processing, as assessed with the P1 component: PSZ exhibited stronger sensory suppression of peripheral stimuli when the task required attending narrowly to the central location, whereas HCS exhibited stronger sensory suppression of central stimuli when the task required attending broadly to the peripheral locations. Moreover, PSZ exhibited a stronger stimulus categorization response than HCS, as assessed with the P3b component, for central stimuli when the task required attending to the peripheral region. These results provide strong evidence of hyperfocusing in PSZ, which may provide a unified mechanistic account of multiple aspects of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia."

Emerging interest has recently focused on markers of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in schizophrenic spectrum disorders, at least in particular subgroups of patients. Altered expression of genes related to oxidative stress, oxidative damage to DNA, protein and lipids, as well as reduced glutathione levels in central and peripheral tissues could act synergistically, and contribute to the course of the disease. Herein, we discuss cellular mechanisms that may be operative in neuroinflammation and contributory to schizophrenia. We address modulation of endogenous cellular defense mechanisms as a potentially innovative approach to therapeutics for schizophrenia, and other neuropsychiatric conditions that are associated with neuroinflammation. Specifically, we discuss the emerging role of heme oxygenase as prominent member of neuroprotective network in redox stress responsive mechanisms, as well as the importance of glutathione relevant in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Finally we introduce the hormetic dose response concept as relevant and important to neuroprotection, and review hormetic mechanisms as possible approaches to manipulation of neuroinflammatory targets that may be viable for treating schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

Parents display disenfranchised grief over multiple losses and report increased levels of emotional burden. Most studies use quantitative methods and rely on pre-existing theoretical frameworks to investigate, through psychometric measures, the effects of being a carer. Meaning attributions to the disorder, and changes in parent-child relations over time, are poorly understood. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This hermeneutic phenomenological study illuminates the subjective experience of parenting a son or daughter with psychosis, as it is lived and described by parents of young adults with psychosis. Findings suggest that the parents' perceptions of their child changes over the course of the disorder, leading to a redefinition of the parent-child relationship, causing alternations in attachment. Findings illuminate the parents' profound guilt over having contributed or not prevented the disorder, over not being good' parents and feeling ambivalent towards an intimate stranger.' Guilt is compensated by absolute dedication to the son or daughter's care, at the expense of their own well-being. What are the implications for practice Interventions for parents must be available as soon as possible, both during hospitalization and after discharge. Professionals should provide a therapeutic space, where parents could express intimate thoughts and feelings, address guilt, fear and resentment issues, be assisted in their parenting role as well as in the reconstruction of a sense of self and self-esteem. Professionals are invited to facilitate illness acceptance, provide accurate information, assist parents to redefine their relationship to the child and facilitate the integration of the traumatic experience into their personal and family narrative. Professionals must develop in depth awareness of their biases and attitudes, have an ongoing training on how to respond to the parents' needs, facilitate therapeutic change and accompany families through the course of their adult child's illness trajectory. Abstract Introduction Children who are diagnosed with psychosis often rely on their parents for prolonged care. The impact of such care is partially understood as most studies use quantitative methods and pre-existing theoretical frameworks that limit their investigation to emotional burden, and emotional responses. Aim Explore the parents' lived experience of caring for a child with psychosis. Method A hermeneutic phenomenological design was used with a sample of 16 parents of children with psychotic disorders who were hospitalized or attended the outpatient clinic of a large psychiatric Greek hospital. Results Identified themes were as follows: (i) the psychosis experience, (ii) redefinition of the parent-child relationship over the course of the disorder and (iii) challenges of parenting a child with psychosis. Discussion Caring for an intimate stranger' reflects the parents' overall experience, involving changes in the parent-child relationship, ambivalence towards caretaking and profound guilt, compensated by self-sacrifice parenting practices. Implications for practice: Findings highlight the necessity to train mental health professionals to provide individualized information; facilitate family communication; address the parents' guilt, ambivalence, meaning attributions that compromise adjustment; and support them through the challenges of parenting a son or daughter with psychosis."

Recently, concerns have been raised about how well United Kingdom National Health Service nurses care for their patients and their level of compassion. Motivational interviewing (MI) is an established approach to helping people make positive behaviour changes, through directive, person-centred counselling within a collaborative relationship between clinician and recipient. Based on evidence that MI may influence nursing practice positively, an investigation into the feasibility of training nurses on mental health inpatient rehabilitation wards (rehabilitation') in MI to improve patient experience was reported. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? This pilot study demonstrates that training rehabilitation nurses in MI is feasible and provides preliminary evidence suggesting that a larger study to examine efficacy is warranted, including a calculation of sample size required to draw robust statistical conclusions. Nurses evaluated the training as highly relevant to their work. Patients responded well to interviews and focus groups with support from experts-by-experience; they were generally fairly satisfied with the rehabilitation ward and slight improvements in their experience were found following MI training for nurses but not at 6-month follow-up. What are the implications for practice? Rehabilitation nurses may face conflicting demands between ensuring patients with severe difficulties meet their basic needs and working with them to develop greater independence. Qualitative findings question whether nurse-patient interactions are fully valued as nursing interventions in inpatient rehabilitation. Learning MI might be a useful way of helping nurses think in detail about their interactions with patients and how to improve communications with their patients. The principles of MI should be incorporated into pre-registration training. Abstract Introduction There is limited research addressing the experiences of patients in inpatient rehabilitation (rehabilitation), who often spend long periods in hospital, and the nursing approaches utilized. Aim Based on evidence that motivational interviewing (MI) may improve nursing practice, this was a pilot study evaluating the feasibility of training rehabilitation nurses in MI and measuring patient experience. Method Nurses underwent training and supervision focusing on MI spirit. Quantitative and qualitative measures were taken pretraining, 2months post-training and 8months post-training. Expert-by-experience research assistants facilitated patients' participation in the study. Results This study showed that training rehabilitation nurses in MI was feasible and relevant to their work. Patients participated in interviews and focus groups with support and potential improvements that require further empirical investigation in patient experience were found following the MI training. Discussion This pilot study establishes the feasibility of a larger study addressing efficacy. Tentative qualitative findings question whether interactions between nurses and patients are valued in rehabilitation and support MI as a promising skill set for rehabilitation nurses. Implications for practice Bringing MI into inpatient rehabilitation provoked reflection on nursing practice. Dilemmas for nurses about balancing safety with promoting autonomy and communicating constructively with patients emerged as important."

This study was performed to assess the cost-effectiveness of aftercare services, including telephone follow-up or home visit, in addition to caregivers' education and training of social skills, for all subjects during the 20 months after hospital discharge. An economic evaluation was performed along with a registered randomised controlled trial (IRCT201009052557N2) on two groups of 60 persons recruited between 2010 and 2012. Intervention's effectiveness was measured by psychopathology and quality of life indicators. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility were analysed from the societal and Ministry of Health (MoH) perspectives. All indicators of psychopathology, quality of life and satisfaction with services in the intervention group were significantly different from the control group. Mean intervention costs was US$674 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 572-776) per subject in the intervention group. Average total direct costs were US$1445 (95% CI: 1086-1804) and US$1640 (95% CI: 1087-2093) per subject in the intervention and control groups respectively. From the societal perspective, intervention had more effects with lower costs. The ratios for incremental cost-effectiveness was US$8399.1 (95% CI: 8178.2-8620.0) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the MoH perspective for 20 months of follow-up. This study showed that aftercare services can create opportunities to use hospital beds more efficiently for unmet needs of people with psychiatric disorders. Indirect and intangible costs were not considered in this study, if taken into account, they are likely to further increase the efficiency of intervention."

Increasingly, calls have intensified for a more biologically-based approach to conceptualizing, studying, and treating psychological disorders, as exemplified by the Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC). Among the most well-studied neurobiological mechanisms is reward processing. Moreover, individual differences in reward sensitivity are related to risk for substance abuse and depression. The current review synthesizes the available preclinical, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging literature on reward processing from a transdiagnostic, multidimensional perspective. Findings are organized with respect to key reward constructs within the Positive Valence Systems domain of the RDoC matrix, including initial responsiveness to reward (physiological 'liking), approach motivation (physiological 'wanting'), and reward learning/habit formation. In the current review, we (a) describe the neural basis of reward, (b) elucidate differences in reward activity in substance abuse and depression, and (c) suggest a framework for integrating these disparate literatures and discuss the utility of shifting focus from diagnosis to process for understanding liability and co-morbidity. Ultimately, we believe that an integrative focus on abnormal reward functioning across the full continuum of clinically heterogeneous samples, rather than within circumscribed diagnostic categories, might actually help to refine the phenotypes and improve the prediction of onset and recovery of these disorders.

This retrospective study examined the treatment of certified patients during a 12-year period (1996 to 2007). A total of 112 patients were treated using 263 certifications during 163 separate hospital admissions. Fifty of all the certified patients (44.6%) required more than one certification, and out of these, 72% required another certification within three months of the first certification. Among those certified, schizophrenia and related psychosis (65.2%, n=73), substance use disorder (50%, n=56) and antisocial personality disorder (58%, n=65) were the most common discharge diagnoses and antipsychotics, the most frequent discharge medications. Global Assessment of Functioning score of patients improved significantly (p<.05) from 43.6 at admission to 50.4 at discharge. This functional improvement may suggest a beneficial use of certification by keeping patients in treatment. This benefit may be enhanced if the statutory duration of certification can be increased to account for the length of time required for the adequate resolution of symptoms and to reduce the need for repeat certification."
1450,Psychology  , Antisocial personality disorder  , Oxytocin; Offensive aggression; Social exploration; Individual variability        ,"A substantial body of research suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin promotes social affiliative behaviors in a wide range of animals including humans. However, its antiaggressive action has not been unequivocally demonstrated in male laboratory rodents. Our primary goal was to examine the putative serenic effect of oxytocin in a feral strain (wild type Groningen, WTG) of rats that generally show a much broader variation and higher levels of intermale aggression than commonly used laboratory strains of rats. Resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain oxytocin functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder. Our data clearly demonstrate that acute icv administered oxytocin produces dose-dependent and receptor-selective changes in social behavior, reducing aggression and potentiating social exploration. These antiaggressive effects are stronger in the more offensive rats. On the other hand, administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist tends to increase (nonsignificantly) aggression only in low-medium aggressive animals. These results suggest that transiently enhancing brain oxytocin function has potent antiaggressive effects, whereas its attenuation tends to enhance aggressiveness. In addition, a possible inverse relationship between trait aggression and endogenous oxytocinergic signaling is revealed. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of brain oxytocinergic signaling for regulating intermale offensive aggression. This study supports the suggestion that oxytocin receptor agonists could clinically be useful for curbing heightened aggression seen in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders like antisocial personality disorder, autism, and addiction."
1665,Psychology  , Antisocial personality disorder  , Conduct disorder; Feedback processing; ERPs        ,"Abnormalities in neural feedback-processing systems may play a role in the development of dysfunctional behavior in individuals diagnosed with conduct disorder (CD). The present study investigated the relation between CD adolescents and feedback processing by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) in a single outcome gambling task, which included reward valence (loss and gain) and reward magnitude (10 and 50 cents) as outcomes. N2 and P3 components have been established as effective indicators in studies of behavioral disinhibition, reward processing, and decision-making. Eighteen adolescent males (age: 13-17 years) diagnosed with CD and 19 healthy age-matched male controls were recruited. Compared to healthy controls, CD individuals exhibited reduced N2 amplitudes in response to loss condition. There was also a significant decreased P3 amplitude in all conditions. The amplitudes of P3 were negatively correlated with impulsivity scores across both groups, and the amplitudes of N2 were positively correlated with impulsivity scores across both groups. Our findings suggest that adolescents with CD may be impaired in neural sensitivity feedback and the processing of environmental cues compared to healthy controls. Moreover, N2 and P3 may be reliable indices to detect different sensitivity in reward and punishment feedback processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Since dopamine is among the substrates for monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), this investigation examines whether functional allelic variants of the MAOA tandem repeat (VNTR) promotor polymorphism, which is known to modulate aggressive behavior, influences dopamine release and aggression in response to violent visual stimuli. We selected from a genetic prescreening sample, strictly case-matched groups of 2 x 12 healthy male subjects with VNTRs predictive of high (MAOA-High) and low (MAOA-Low) MAOA expression. Subjects underwent pairs of PET sessions (dopamine D-2/3 ligand [F-18]DMFP) while viewing a movie of neutral content, versus violent content. Directly afterwards, aggressive behavior was assessed by the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP). Finally, PET data of 23 participants and behavioral data of 22 participants were analyzed due to post hoc exclusion criteria. In the genetic prescreening sample MAOA-Low carriers had significantly increased scores on the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. In the PET-study-group, aggressive behavior under the emotional neutral condition was significantly higher in the MAOA-Low group. Interestingly, the two MAOA-groups showed inverse dopaminergic and behavioral reactions to the violent movie: The MAOA-High group showed higher dopamine release and increased aggression after the violent movie; MAOA-Low subjects showed decreases in aggressive behavior and no consistent dopamine release. These results indicate a possible impact of the MAOA-promotor polymorphism on the neurobiological modulation of aggressive behavior. However, the data do not support approaches stating that MAOA-Low fosters aggression by a simple pro-dopaminergic mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The present study confirmed this hypothesis, revealing that participants who played an aggressive video game using their own, personalized character exhibited higher levels of aggressive behavior than participants who played an aggressive game with a non-personalized character. The aggressive behavior levels of the own-character players also exceeded those of individuals who played a non-aggressive game, regardless of whether or not they used a personalized character. Process analyses revealed that participants playing a violent video game with a personalized game character experienced more arousal and self-activation than they did when playing with an impersonal, default game character, which in turn increased aggressive responses.

Therefore, the current study investigated whether problem garners are characterized by deficits in various aspects of cognitive control (inhibitory control, error processing, attentional control) by measuring brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging during Go-NoGo and Stroop task performance. In addition, both impulsivity and attentional control were measured using self-reports. Participants comprised 18 problem garners who were compared with 16 matched casual gaming controls. Results indicate significantly increased self-reported impulsivity levels and decreased inhibitory control accompanied by reduced brain activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right inferior parietal lobe (LPL) in problem garners relative to controls. Significant hypoactivation in the left IFG in problem garners was also observed during Stroop task performance, but groups did not differ on behavioral and self-reported measures of attentional control. No evidence was found for reduced error processing in problem garners. In conclusion, the current study provides evidence for reduced inhibitory control in problem garners, while attentional control and error processing were mostly intact. These findings implicate that reduced inhibitory control and elevated impulsivity may constitute a neurocognitive weakness in problem garners. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved"

Interpretation of effect sizes derived from seven meta-analyses encompassing different forms of media violence and resultant different varieties of aggressive and antisocial behavior supports a robust hypothesis of media influence. Causation, implied by outcomes of pooled experimental and survey designs, is consistent across these aggregations. The media take up a role as oppressors of an underclass with limited access to opportunities for improvement."

However, it remains unclear whether the results flowing from this literature are generalizable to other samples and whether previously observed associations are confounded due to uncontrolled genetic influences. The current study addresses these limitations using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). The results of the preliminary models, which do not include controls for genetic influences, produced a pattern of results similar to those previously reported in the extant literature. The results of the genetically informed models revealed that the associations between television viewing and antisocial outcomes are not causal, but rather are driven by uncontrolled genetic influences. Further replication is required, but these findings suggest that results drawn from the extant literature may not be trustworthy."

We examined chromogranin A, somatostatin, ghrelin, glucagon, and serotonin expression by immunohistochemistry in 2 embryos, 38 fetuses, and 3 infants in the corpus of human stomach. Chromogranin A secreting endocrine cells were identified in the corpus at week 10 of gestation. Somatostatin cells were present from the 10th week, ghrelin and serotonin cells from the 11th week, and glucagon cells from the 12th week of gestation. Endocrine cells were present individually or clustered within the glandular base and body during the first trimester, and were present separately within the basal and central parts of glands during the second and third trimesters. Somatostatin cells were the most common type of cells (similar to 46 %) during the first trimestercond trimester (similar to 34 %), and in infants (similar to 28 %). The percentage of glucagon cells was significant only during the first trimester of pregnancy (5.5 %), and the percentage of serotonin cells was only significant just before birth (4.8 %). These results show, for the first time, that the largest number of endocrine cells are present in the corpus during the first trimester of prenatal development. Also, these results suggest that secretory products of endocrine cells play a role in the regulation of homeostasis, growth, and differentiation, and in human stomach function."
28,Psychology  , Prenatal development  , female alternative morphotype; female masculinization; maternal effects; reproductive traits; social context        ,"1. Alternative morphotypes have been reported less frequently in females than in males. An exception to this rule is the gradient of phenotypical masculinization reported in some female mammals, in which feminized and masculinized females represent two opposite ends along this gradient. These phenotypical differences originate during prenatal development as the consequence of maternal effects. Feminized and masculinized females differ in several traits, including morphological, physiological, behavioural and reproductive traits. 2. Differences previously reported in reproductive traits between feminized and masculinized females come mostly from mechanistic studies performed in the laboratory, and not necessarily on social species. As a result, it is unclear to what extent these reported differences between female alternative morphotypes materialize in wild, natural populations. 3. We quantified the effect of female alternative morphotype on female reproductive traits in a natural population of Octodon degus, a highly social rodent. We assessed female alternative morphotype through a continuous gradient of anogenital distance. Thus, feminized females were close to the short end of anogenital distance, while masculinized females were close to the long end of this gradient. We also tested the hypothesis that the social environment interacts with female morphotype to influence female reproductive traits. 4. In female degus, only body weight affected litter size, where heavier females weaned more offspring. Masculinized females delivered male-biased litters and weaned heavier offspring. Lastly, masculinized females gave birth later in the breeding season compared to feminized females. 5. Contrary to previous claims, our findings do not support that masculinized females are less fertile than feminized females. Moreover, masculinized females produced heavier, potentially higher quality offspring compared with feminized females."

Elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this unlimited growth potential is of broad interest for tooth regenerative therapies. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is essential for the development of mouse incisors and for maintenance of the CL during prenatal development. However, how FGF signaling in DESCs controls the self-renewal and differentiation of the cells is not well understood. Herein, we report that FGF signaling is essential for self-renewal and the prevention of cell differentiation of DESCs in the CL as well as in DESC spheres. Inhibiting the FGF signaling pathway decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of the cells in DESC spheres. Suppressing FGFR or its downstream signal transduction pathways diminished Lgr5-expressing cells in the CL and promoted cell differentiation both in DESC spheres and the CL. Furthermore, disruption of the FGF pathway abrogated Wnt signaling to promote Lgr5 expression in DESCs both in vitro and in vivo. This study sheds new light on understanding the mechanism by which the homeostasis, expansion, and differentiation of DESCs are regulated."
309,Psychology  , Prenatal development  , Visual cortex; Extrastriate; Synaptic zinc; Visual development        ,"A critical question in brain development is whether different brain circuits mature concurrently or with different timescales. To characterize the anatomical and functional development of different visual cortical areas, one must be able to distinguish these areas. Here, we show that zinc histochemistry, which reveals a subset of glutamatergic processes, can be used to reliably distinguish visual areas in juvenile and adult ferret cerebral cortex, and that the postnatal decline in levels of synaptic zinc follows a broadly similar developmental trajectory in multiple areas of ferret visual cortex. Zinc staining in all areas examined (17, 18, 19, 21, and Suprasylvian) is greater in the 5-week-old than in the adult. Furthermore, there is less laminar variation in zinc staining in the 5-week-old visual cortex than in the adult. Despite differences in staining intensity, areal boundaries can be discerned in the juvenile as in the adult. By 6 weeks of age, we observe a significant decline in visual cortical synaptic zinc; this decline was most pronounced in layer IV of areas 17 and 18, with much less change in higher-order extrastriate areas during the important period in visual cortical development following eye opening. By 10 weeks of age, the laminar pattern of zinc staining in all visual areas is essentially adultlike. The decline in synaptic zinc in the supra- and infragranular layers in all areas proceeds at the same rate, though the decline in layer IV does not. These results suggest that the timecourse of synaptic zinc decline is lamina specific, and further confirm and extend the notion that at least some aspects of cortical maturation follow a similar developmental timecourse in multiple areas. The postnatal decline in synaptic zinc we observe during the second postnatal month begins after eye opening, consistent with evidence that synaptic zinc is regulated by sensory experience."

General support for this hypothesis has been provided by studies of postpubertal circulating levels of testosterone, at least among males. However, the theory also predicts that for both genders, prenatal androgens will be positively correlated with persistent offending, an idea for which no evidence currently exists. The present study used an indirect measure of prenatal androgen exposurethe relative length of the second and fourth fingers of the right hand (r2D:4D)to test the hypothesis that elevated prenatal androgens promote criminal tendencies later in life for males and females. Questionnaires were administered to 2,059 college students in Malaysia and 1,291 college students in the United States. Respondents reported their r2D:4D relative finger lengths along with involvement in 13 categories of delinquent and criminal acts. Statistically significant correlations between the commission of most types of offenses and r2D:4D ratios were found for males and females even after controlling for age. It is concluded that high exposure to androgens during prenatal development contributes to most forms of offending following the onset of puberty."

We sought to estimate the effects of economic factors on risk of child maltreatment after adjusting for other known influences using the Australian Temperament Project, a population-based birth cohort of 2443 individuals and their parents. We used logistic regression to estimate associations of childhood economic factors (parental education, occupation, and unemployment; type of housing; and retrospective perception of poverty) with retrospective reports of perceived child maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and witnessing of domestic violence), controlling for demographic factors, parental mental health and substance use, and child health. We then used these estimates to approximate the proportions of child maltreatment population attributable fractions that are theoretically preventable by addressing childhood economic disadvantage. Economic factors were associated with all types of child maltreatment. For the most part, these associations diminished only partially when controlling for noneconomic con-founders, supporting hypotheses of causal relationships. Jointly, economic factors were significant predictors of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing of domestic violence but not of emotional abuse or neglect. Retrospective perceptions of childhood poverty were, in particular, strongly associated with most forms of child maltreatment but not with sexual abuse after accounting for other economic factors. We estimated that 27% of all child maltreatment was jointly attributable to economic factors. These findings suggest that strategies that reduce economic disadvantage are likely to hold significant potential to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Costs were primarily estimated through calculation of population attributable fractions (PAFs) to determine the marginal effects of child maltreatment on a range of outcomes. PAFs were then applied to estimates of expenditure, inflated to 2014-15 Australian dollars, projected over the life course, according to a baseline age of incident cases for child maltreatment in 2012-13, and discounted at 7% per annum. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using a best and lower bound estimate of incidence of child abuse. The best estimate of the total estimated lifetime financial costs for incident cases of child maltreatment in 2012-13 was $9.3 billion (a cost per child maltreated of $176,437), with a lower bound of $5.8 billion. The best estimate of lifetime costs associated with reduced quality of life and premature mortality (non-financial costs) for all incident cases of child maltreatment in 2012-13 was $17.4 billion, or $328,757 per child maltreated. The considerable lifetime costs associated with child maltreatment warrants an expansion of existing investment in primary and secondary prevention and targeted support services for children and families at risk.

Disparate findings may be due to lack of attention to the nature of maltreatment experiences in each generation. We sought to expand the current literature by examining the role of maltreatment type, perpetrator identity, and substantiation status of reports to child protective services (CPS) on intergenerational maltreatment among adolescent mothers (n = 417) and their children. We found that when mothers had at least one report of childhood maltreatment (substantiated or not), the odds that they maltreated their children increased by 72% (OR = 2.52), compared to mothers who are not maltreated, but the odds were considerably lower when we limited analysis to substantiated reports. Both a maternal history of substantiated neglect and multiple type maltreatment (neglect and physical or sexual abuse) were associated with increased risk of child maltreatment, yet the likelihood of children experiencing multiple maltreatment perpetrated with their mothers identified as perpetrators increased over 300% when mothers had a childhood history of multiple maltreatment.

However, socially constructed gender roles can lead to equal rights between genders but also to severe disadvantages and discrimination with a remarkable variety between different countries. Based on social indicators and gender statistics, ""women in the Arab region are on average more disadvantaged economically, politically, and socially than women in other regions."" According to Banduras' social learning theory, we argue that profound knowledge of the historical contributions of Ancient Egyptian female pioneers in science, arts, and even in ruling Egypt as Pharaohs can improve today's gender role in Egypt and Middle Eastern countries. Therefore, this article provides an elaborate review of the gender role of women in Ancient Egypt, outlining their prominence, influence, and admiration in ancient societies, and discusses the possible psychological impact of this knowledge on today's gender role. We suggest that future empirical research should investigate how enhancing the knowledge of women from Ancient Egypt can improve today's gender role in Egypt and the Middle East.

However, this area has received little attention in the highly gender-segregated context of Pakistan. Understanding evidence-based issues related to gender in Pakistan is thus crucial to overcoming educational barriers. This article explored Pakistani female pre-primary teachers' perceptions and practices related to gender in the early years. Interview and observation data were collected with seven teachers in one urban, co-education school and were analysed thematically. Results indicated that teachers' perceptions reflect the complex and multifaceted dimensions of gender within the gradually shifting, but still traditional, cultures of Pakistani society. For the most part, female teachers' views are rooted in dominant patriarchal ideologies, for example, of boys as active and assertive and girls as passive and quiet. However, in a few instances such as in children's academic performance and play, their perceptions reflect attempts to push gender boundaries which challenge patriarchal ideologies. Teachers' gender perceptions have significant implications for young children's development and understanding of gender roles in Pakistan."

746,Psychology  , Gender roles  , Women; cinema; WWI; feminism; gender; Italy        ,"A mix of fantasy, history, spirituality, and political engagement, Elvira Giallanella's film, Umanita (1920), is a sort of Carrollian 'through the looking glass' in which reality resembles itself but upside-down. In the immediate aftermath of WWI, Giallanella's film - a revision of Vittorio Emanuele Bravetta's 1916 children's story from 1916 children's story - both reflects and critiques gender roles that had been temporarily fissured by the war itself. A feminist position transpires in the juxtaposition of the pre-war male-authored text with the postwar female-directed film, further revised by men. An invaluable historical source, Umanita not only offers insight into a woman's and a feminist's perspective on the Great War and its aftermath but also sheds light on the moral, political, and philosophical atmosphere of destabilization at the time. Coming full circle, Umanita suffered from the very same revisions by the re-established postwar patriarchy, and by the end of the 1920s, cinema itself had been reclaimed as male territory, leaving the film lost amongst the debris. Umanita's resurfacing in 2007 allows us to reflect on the process of history-making in itself: what is omitted, what is included, and more importantly whose voices will be validated enough to be heard along the way. This instance - one amongst several - can serve as an example of how history is indeed a continuous process made up of (re)visions, and never a singular, univocal one."

Studies have suggested that semantic dysfunction in AD is the result of deficits to either semantic process, semantic content or both. Studies that have supported the loss of semantic content have been criticised for their use of verbal stimuli and cognitively challenging experimental tasks. The current study used a novel version of the yes no recognition memory task to compare the processing of distinctive and non-distinctive features in participants with AD whilst controlling the cognitive demands of the task. The task involved five conditions which denoted the relationship between the items in the test and study phase. A 'non-distinctive' and a 'distinctive' condition were included where non-distinctive and distinctive semantic features were manipulated between study and test, respectively. Task accuracy of participants with AD decreased relative to control participants when distinctive features were manipulated between the study and test phase of the experiment. There was no significant difference between groups when non-distinctive features were manipulated. These findings provide evidence to support the loss of semantic content in AD.

239,Psychology  , False memories  , source monitoring; false memory        ,"A common finding in the source monitoring literature is that greater similarity impairs source discriminability. Experiments traditionally manipulate similarity overtly by describing or showing sources with explicitly differentiable features. However, people may also infer source characteristics themselves, which should also affect discriminability. Two studies examined inferred source characteristics by capitalizing on the out-group homogeneity effect, whereby in-group members are conceptualized as more diverse than out-group members. Participants learned about two sources who were described only as members of an in-group or an out-group and whose actions did not have higher a priori association with either group. Source memory was superior when participants believed the sources to be in-group members. This demonstrates that people spontaneously include inferred features with source representations and can capitalize on these features during source monitoring. Interestingly, information suggesting membership in one's in-group improved performance even for sources who had previously been considered out-group members (Experiment 2)."

For example, prior investigations of speech-in-noise have revealed there is more to learning than just listening: Even if all words within a spoken list are correctly heard in noise, later memory for those words is typically impoverished. These investigations supported a view that there is a ""gap"" between the intelligibility of speech and memory for that speech. Here, the notion was that this gap between speech intelligibility and memorability is a function of the extent to which the spoken message seizes limited immediate memory resources (e.g., Kiellberg et al., 2008). Accordingly, the more difficult the processing of the spoken message, the less resources are available for elaboration, storage, and recall of that spoken material. However, it was not previously known how increasing that difficulty affected the memory processing of semantically rich spoken material. This investigation showed that noise impairs higher levels of cognitive analysis. A variant of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott procedure that encourages semantic elaborative processes was deployed. On each trial, participants listened to a 36-item list comprising 12 words blocked by each of 3 different themes. Each of those 12 words (e.g., bed, tired, snore...) was associated with a ""critical"" lure theme word that was not presented (e.g., sleep). Word lists were either presented without noise or at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 decibels upon an A-weighting. Noise reduced false recall of the critical words, and decreased the semantic clustering of recall. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."

Shortly thereafter, such data rapidly accumulated in many spheres of human learning and animal conditioning, and Estes' work stimulated vigorous development of Markov models to handle them. A key outcome was that the data of the workhorse paradigms of episodic memory, recognition and recall, proved to be one- and two-stage Markovian, respectively, to close approximations. Subsequently, Markov modeling of recognition and recall all but disappeared from the literature, but it is now reemerging in the wake of dual-process conceptions of episodic memory. In recall, in particular, Markov models are being used to measure two retrieval operations (direct access and reconstruction) and a slave familiarity operation.

Here we evaluate how older adults process out-of-context words and sentences differently by examining patterns of memory errors. In two experiments, we explored younger and older adults' sensitivity to lures on a recognition test following study of words in these two types of contexts. Among the studied words were compound words such as ""blackmail"" and ""jailbird"" that were related to conjunction lures (e. g., ""blackbird"") and semantic lures (e. g., ""criminal""). Participants engaged in a recognition test that included old items, conjunction lures, semantic lures, and unrelated new items. In both experiments, younger and older adults had the same general pattern of memory errors: more incorrect endorsements of semantic than conjunction lures following sentence study and more incorrect endorsements of conjunction than semantic lures following list study. The similar pattern reveals that older and younger adults responded to the constraints of the two different study contexts in similar ways. However, although younger and older adults showed similar levels of memory performance for the list study context, the sentence study context elicited superior memory performance in the older participants. It appears as though memory tasks that take advantage of greater expertise in older adults-in this case, greater experience with sentence processing-can reveal superior memory performance in the elderly."

Daphnetin, a naturally occurring catechol from the family thymelaeaceae, has a chemical structure similar to several potent COMT inhibitors reported previously. Here the potential of daphnetin and its Phase II metabolites as inhibitors of COMT was investigated with human liver cytosol (HLC). 2. Daphnetin and its methylated metabolite (8-O-methyldaphnetin) were found to inhibit COMT-mediated dopamine O-methylation in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values for daphnetin (0.51 similar to 0.53 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (22.5 similar to 24.3 mu M) were little affected by changes in HLC concentrations. Further kinetic analysis showed the differences in inhibition type and parameters (K-i) between daphnetin (competitive, 0.37 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (noncompetitive, 25.7 mu M). Other metabolites, including glucuronidated and sulfated species, showed negligible inhibition against COMT. By using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IV-IVE), a 24.3-fold increase in the exposure of the COMT substrates was predicted when they are co-administrated with daphnetin. 3. With high COMT-inhibiting activity, daphnetin could serve as a lead compound for the design and development of new COMT inhibitors. Also, much attention should be paid to the clinical impact of combination of daphnetin and herbal preparations containing daphnetin with the drugs primarily cleared by COMT."

One hundred Spanish pre-reading children were evaluated on their MEP, naming speed (RAN), phonemic awareness (PA), letter knowledge (LK) and IQ. Early reading level was measured in first grade. In third grade, four reading lists consisting of short and long, high- and low-frequency words were administered. Results from path analyses revealed that, after controlling for RAN, PA, LK, IQ and early reading level, MEP was a significant predictor of the reading of long low frequency words only. This result suggests that, in the transparent Spanish orthography, pre-reading MEP is significantly linked to future decoding skill. This is the first study to provide empirical evidence that pre-reading MEP predicts future reading. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The PM-AuNPs composite modified electrode was used as an electrocatalyst for oxidation of catechol (CC) due to its well-defined redox behavior and enhanced electro-oxidation ability towards CC than other modified electrodes. Under optimized conditions, the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used for the determination of CC. The DPV response of CC was linear over the concentration ranging from 0.5 to 175.5 mu M with a detection limit of 0.011 mu M. The PM-AuNPs composite modified electrode exhibits the high selectivity in the presence of range of potentially interfering compounds including dihydroxybenzene isomers. The sensor shows excellent practicality in CC containing water"

The results can be used to accurately represent the mechanical properties in finite element models that predict the stress and strain distribution in these magnets. Particular attention is paid to anisotropic mechanical behavior of the different magnet materials. Static and dynamic test methods have been applied for determining elastic materials' behavior, and highly accurate Young's moduli are obtained with the nondestructive dynamic methods resonance and impulse excitation at ambient temperature and during in situ heat cycles."

In particular, this program chose to emphasize early career mentoring and early access to research. This goal was chosen because research has been repeatedly shown to increase scientific identity resulting in increased retention of students in the STEM fields. Several elements of this program have been useful in preparing students to access research programs early in their college careers including a summer bridge program, career mentoring, advising, and a second year ""research bootcamp"" course."

Thus, the current study examined prospection (i.e., the ability to remember to carry out a future intention), executive functioning, and intelligence markers as predictors of performance in this widely used naturalistic planning task in 56 children aged 7- to 12-years-old. Measures of planning, prospection, inhibition, crystallized intelligence, and fluid intelligence were collected in an individual differences study. Regression analyses showed that prospection (rather than traditional measures of intelligence or inhibition) predicted planning, suggesting that naturalistic planning tasks such as the Zoo Map task may rely on future-oriented cognitive processes rather than executive problem solving or general knowledge."

The intervention included increasing information on psychoactive substances used for stress reduction; skills development in stress reduction methods; improving skills in communication and problem-solving. All students who participated in the previous health survey were targeted. Mental status of the participants was assessed by a questionnaire before (n: 128, 22% male, mean age 23.21 years) and after (n: 148, 30% male, mean age 23.54 years) the intervention. Specifically, self-efficacy as outcome was approximated by a trait measure (sense of coherence); psychological distress was measured by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg et al., 1997. The validity of two versions of the GHQ in the WHO study of mental illness in general health care. Psychological Medicine, 27, 191-197) after the intervention compared with that before. After the intervention, psychological distress was reduced among the participants (p: 0.013). Non-significant improvement occurred in the mean score for sense of coherence (from a mean 60.8 points before to 61.4 points after, p: 0.688). The intervention produced a modest but significant decrease in psychological distress in students at a cost of 54 US$ per 1 point improvement in mental distress. The intervention, a first example of the translation of the social cognitive theory into practice among students in higher education can be integrated into the curriculum as a standardized optional course."

It was learnt that those problem solving frameworks are originated mainly from practical exercises of practitioners and/or improvement/revision of an earlier frameworks. Against this bottom-up approach in the establishment of problem solving frameworks, this paper continues promoting the establishment of a problem solving framework following top-down approach by synthesizing the deductive inference i.e., the second inference process of Pragmatism's scientific method. The synthesis has resulted in the identification of the decision sub-processes of Pragmatism's deductive inference namely analysis and demonstration. This paper posits that these two decision processes are aligned with both the key and strategies of the decision processes of the renowned problem solving frameworks in practice in management, business, mathematics, healthcare and law and hence, the decision processes of deductive inference in particular and Pragmatism's philosophical method in general is an alternative for decision making processes and problem solving frameworks following the top-down approach."

Contrary to this, productive failure (as well as invention learning, desirable difficulties and other problem-solving-first) frameworks suggest that scaffolded problem-solving activities (a generation phase) preceding explicit instruction enhance learners' performance. The reported experimental study investigated the effectiveness of different levels of instructional guidance provided to students during the learning phase preceding explicit instruction in standard solution procedures in enhancing students' engagement and transfer problem-solving skills. Specifically, the study compared partially-guided or unguided attempts at generating problem solutions as opposed to comprehensive guidance, in the form of a worked example. Levels of experienced cognitive load and learner motivation were evaluated in addition to delayed post-test performance scores. There were no differences between the three groups on the transfer post-test outcomes, even though the condition with fully-guided worked examples prior to the explicit instruction expectedly reduced cognitive load relative to the conditions without such guidance. There were also differences between the conditions on some sub-dimensions of the motivation scale. In general, the findings indicate that similar overall outcomes (delayed transfer performance) could be achieved by different sequences of instructional tasks aimed at achieving different sets of specific goals."

However, the increasing significance of 3D vs. 2D cell culture has initiated a new era in cell culture research in which 3D in vitro models are emerging as a bridge between traditional 2D cell culture and in vivo animal models. Additive manufacturing (AM, also known as 3D printing), defined as the layer-by-layer fabrication of parts directed by digital information from a 3D computer-aided design file, offers the advantages of simultaneous rapid prototyping and biofunctionalization as well as the precise placement of cells and extracellular matrix with high resolution. In this review, we highlight recent advances in 3D printing of tissue engineered constructs that recapitulate the physical and cellular properties of the tissue microenvironment for investigating mechanisms of disease progression and for screening drugs."

The model uses a carefully designed charge carrier generation profile that describes how an electron beam induces charge carriers in a semiconducting device and then drift-diffusion equations are solved to determine the resulting current. The simulation provides a map of the EBIC signal, which can be compared with experimental 2-D profiles. This comparison can be used to fit parameters such as the surface recombination rate which is otherwise difficult to fit in completed devices. Additional experimental data for these fits are obtained by performing the experiments at different electron beam energies and thereby generating carriers at different depths in the sample. The experiments were performed on cross sections of silicon photodiodes with varying surface preparations. A strong influence of the surface preparation method on the charge carrier diffusion was observed."

For that purpose, subdivision surfaces using triangle meshes are simultaneously applied to CAD (computer aided design) modeling and CAE (computer aided engineering) analysis. In this framework, feature objects are defined by the subdivision model, so that the subdivision models can be controlled by geometric parameters. Global optimization with metaheuristic algorithms is then performed, and an independent coefficients (IC) reanalysis method is introduced to enhance the efficiency of optimization. In order to improve the accuracy of triangular meshes, the ES-FEM (edge-based smoothed finite element method) technique is employed for analysis work. The proposed approach is successfully tested in three real engineering geometry optimization problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Aim of the paper is to work out the analytic expression of the current and of the terminal charges, along with the surface potential and the electric field as a function of position in the channel. The availability of the surface potential and of the electric field is the key to model advanced physical effects as, for example, the carrier injection from the electrodes into the channel."

They allow for clean, time-saving dissection, manipulation of structures and appreciation of anatomical relationships, and potential elimination of the need for cadavers. The present study tests the hypothesis that using holographic models improves mastery of anatomical information. First-year medical students were taught gross anatomy using the dissection of donor cadavers, manipulation of digitized 3-dimensional holographic renderings, and examination of plastinated specimens. The effectiveness of these approaches was assessed by comparing students' performance on identification questions on cadavers (qC), holographic models (qH), and plastinated specimens (qP). Students in the top quintile of the class performed strongly on qC, qH, and qP. In contrast, performance by students in the bottom quintile was uneven; they scored best on qH. Performance on the qP was relatively non-discriminating. Students in the top quintile scored higher on the biological sciences section of the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) than students in the lowest quintile, whereas students in the lowest quintile had higher scores on the verbal section of their MCATs. The availability of different approaches for presenting gross anatomy improves the success of students in mastering the material, particularly for students struggling with the information. The use of holographic models apparently reaches students who may be challenged to learn the material using traditional approaches. This may be linked to potentially predictive information gleaned through performance on the MCAT. Clin. Anat. 29:917-924, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
43,MAE , Hydraulics  , elevated CO2; eucalyptus; genotype; leaf economics; leaf hydraulics; photosynthetic capacity; trait coordination        ,"1. Leaf economics and hydraulic traits strongly influence photosynthesis. While the level of coordination among these traits can differ between sets of species, leaf functional trait coordination within species remains poorly understood. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 commonly influence the expression of leaf photosynthetic, economics and hydraulic traits in contrasting ways, yet the effect of variable concentrations of atmospheric CO2 on patterns of trait coordination within species remains largely untested. 2. We examined the relationships among key leaf photosynthetic (e. g. net photosynthesis and photosynthetic biochemistry), economics and water-use (e. g. leaf mass per unit area and stomatal conductance) and hydraulic traits (e. g. vein density) in 14 genotypes of Eucalyptus camaldulensis grown in ambient (aCO(2)) and elevated (eCO(2)) [CO2]. We examined the level of coordination among leaf traits in aCO(2) and then assessed whether growth in eCO(2) altered that coordination. 3. We found that leaf traits related to photosynthetic capacity, economics and water-use, and hydraulics were decoupled among genotypes grown in aCO(2), yet strong relationships were generally observed among suites of traits within each 'functional group'. 4. Significant responses to growth in eCO(2) were observed for most leaf photosynthetic and economics and water-use traits, with the magnitude and direction of the response varying among traits. In contrast, leaf hydraulics traits were unaffected by variable growth CO2. Despite this, growth in eCO(2) did not substantially alter patterns of leaf trait coordination observed in aCO(2). 5. These results suggest suites of leaf traits associated with photosynthetic capacity, economics and water-use and hydraulics, respectively, can form independent axes of variation among genotypes of a single species, regardless of growth CO2. Although growth in eCO(2) did not substantially alter patterns of trait coordination, decoupling of leaf functional traits among genotypes may allow genetically distinct populations to produce novel combinations of traits that may be adaptive in response to changes in their local environment."
56,MAE , Hydraulics  , cavitation; hydraulic conductivity; safety margin; vulnerability segmentation; water potential        ,"1. Vulnerability segmentation hypothesis proposes that plant branches are more resistant to cavitation than their terminal leaves, namely, the difference in vulnerability to cavitation between branches and their terminal leaves is positive (P50leaf-branch>0). This allows leaves to act as safety valves to protect hydraulic pathway from dysfunction. 2. Recent studies showed that several species from humid regions have negative values of P50leaf-branch, indicating a lack of vulnerability segmentation in these species (LVS species). 3. We hypothesize that compared with species from humid regions, vulnerability segmentation is critical and necessary for arid species to survive droughts, but LVS species may take compensatory hydraulic strategies to maintain safety margins during drought periods. 4. We compile branch and leaf hydraulic trait data of 69 broadleaved woody species belonging to different biomes with contrasting climatic conditions as indicated by variable aridity index (AI), and we find that P50leaf-branch becomes small and even negative with the increase of AI. Although leaves of LVS species may lose their function as safety valves, their deep rooting, great hydraulic conductivity, and/or high stem capacitance features are critical for them to maintain hydraulic safety. 5. The results indicate that vulnerability segmentation is evidently common for species from arid regions, but not necessarily the case for some species from humid regions. With robust cavitation-resistant leaves and effective hydraulic compensatory strategies, LVS species can maintain water supply and the functionality of leaves, thus giving them a hydraulic advantage over counterparts in the face of potential drought stress.

NMR takes the advantages of the two-phase flow driving head, which allows a much smaller and simpler reactor pressure vessel (RPV) compared to the integral PWRs. In this study, through a systematic stepwise optimization approach including a simulated annealing based optimization method, an optimum core design that meets a 10-year cycle length with a minimum fuel cost while satisfying safety related criteria was derived and analyzed. The lattice code CASMO-4, the whole core analysis code PARCS and the thermal-hydraulics code RELAP5 were used to perform calculations from pin cell up to whole core depletion calculations. The NMR-50 optimized core design is able to achieve a 10.2 year cycle length with an average fuel enrichment of 4.61 wt% of U-235 in a 10 x 10 lattice fuel assembly. The minimum critical power ratio (MCPR) and the maximum fuel linear power density (MFLPD) during the cycle are 1.99 and 18.25 kW/m, respectively, providing large margins to thermal design constraints. The NMR-50 control system design is able to provide a sufficient cold shutdown margin of 1.7%. With its small reactor core size, large negative void coefficient, and low operating thermal neutron flux, an enhanced xenon stability characteristic is possible. Peak fast neutron fluence of 8.8 x 10(21) n/cm(2) was below the industry standard limit, which from extensive plant data records, should not be a major concern to channel distortions from a radiation damage point of view.

Staggered mesh, finite volume method, semi-implicit first order upwind scheme and Successive Over Relaxation (SOR) method are used to discretize and solve two-phase mass, momentum and energy equations. Single-phase natural circulation experiments under rolling condition performed in Institute of nuclear and new energy technology of Tsinghua University and two-phase natural circulation experiments under rolling condition performed by Tan and colleagues are used to validate PNCMC. The validation results indicate that PNCMC is capable to investigate the single-phase and two-phase natural circulation under rolling motion."

Performance was assessed in terms of ammonia and solids removal, hydraulic conductivity and mixing patterns. The capability of systems to produce ammonium effluent concentrations <3 mgNH(4)(+)-N/L was observed across all sites in systems receiving variable loadings between 0.1 and 13.0 gNH(4)(+)-N/m(2)/d. Potential resilience issues were observed in relation to response to spike loadings posited to be due to an insufficient nitrifying population within the beds. Hydraulic conductivity and flow mixing patterns observed suggested deterioration of the reactor effective volume over time. Overall, the study demonstrates the efficacy of the technology where ammonium removal is required on small sites receiving high and variable flow rates, with adequate removal of organics and solids, but no significant benefit to the long term hydraulics of the system."

This variation requires additional energy requirements that limits the attainable aspect ratios, flux density levels and stresses the supply. A numerical methodology that accounts for the flux leakage and the eddy currents is proposed to analyze uniformity and variation in B in four 2-D magnetizers. The analysis was done beyond the knee of the magnetization curve. Numerical results will show that round magnetizers can mitigate the variation of the square magnetizer by over 92%, by making the MMF more sinusoidal and equalizing the reluctance along the airgap. In addition, deeper yokes minimized the variation by about 50% in the square and the Halbach testers. The results of this analysis was a design that mitigates the variation in B by a combination of sinusoidally distributed windings, and a deep yoke. The proposed magnetizer achieved very high flux densities over a relatively wide frequency range, which were 2.04 and 1.69 T at 60 Hz and 1 kHz, respectively."

General aspects of machine design arising from the large air-gap length of the machine are discussed using 2D-Finite Element Analysis. It is found that the design rules for conventional or even alternate FSPM machines can no longer be applied when a large air-gap is present. Particularly the choice of rotor poles is investigated to improve the torque capability of the FSPM machine in detail. Within the machine design it is necessary to reduce the number of rotor poles which is also beneficial for the reduction of losses at increased rotor speeds. Moreover, the height of the permanent magnets in the stator also need to be enlarged due to the large air-gap machines to prevent a direct short circuit of the permanent magnet flux in the air-gap.

On average around 20 students enroll in this project-based course and 72% of their grade depends on three comprehensive group projects, one of which is to design a bone plate for a fractured femur. 6% of the grade comes from an individual application presentation, discussing different circumstances in which the concepts in mechanical engineering can be applied to solve/analyze biomedical problems. Background of physiology is introduced in the class while the majority of applicable engineering knowledge was learned in prerequisite courses, such as statics, dynamics, strength of materials, system dynamics, etc. Finite Element Analysis (FEA), an elective offered in both semesters of senior year, is not a prerequisite for this bioengineering course. Most of students enrolled in our bioengineering course either do not have FEA course or are taking FEA concurrently. Therefore in spite of its popularity in the areas related to biomechanics, thus far FEA has not been incorporated in this bioengineering course. Previously, the fractured femur project utilized the applicable theoretical analyses including those from statics, strength of materials, materials, and machine design. In Fall 2015, the instructor of bioengineering course made an effort to have an FEA study on femur and ensuing presentation be completed by a willing student. This student was taking FEA simultaneously with bioengineering, and was scheduled to present during the last week of semester. The instructor of FEA wrote an introductory manual of FEA procedures to analyze a healthy femur using a CAD model of the femur. Then the student used the manual to initiate the FEA study of the fractured femur. A major challenge to the student was the complicated loading and assembly feature of the bone plus the addition of bone plate. After a several week struggle and independent learning, while guided by the faculty members of bioengineering and FEA, the student was able to accomplish the FEA analysis and presented the results to the class. The discrepancy between FEA results and theoretical analysis was shown to be less than 5% in most results. The presentation also included FEA results for a diverse realistic loading and boundary conditions. Since all students had finished the fractured femur project, they actively participated in a meaningful discussion after the presentation. The completion of this project demonstrated the feasibility and importance of incorporating FEA in our bioengineering course. In addition, the presenting student was able to complete a working manual for the FEA analysis of the fractured femur, which can be passed to the future students of this course. A plan is to include FEA in the project as a bonus activity, and regarding the formation of project teams, the instructor would appoint a member who is enrolled in the FEA course. An assignment or project, based on the present FEA study of the femur, can also be incorporated in the FEA course offered at our campus."

The fracture areas were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the crack initiation and propagation were discussed. The punches failed by chipping wear mechanism due to low-cycle fatigue. Their repeating failures provoked by faulty machine design. Problem solving suggestions are proposed. In addition, alternatives related to material selection are provided in order to reduce crack susceptibility, in an economical way.

8,MAE , Fluid mechanics  , plumes/thermals; turbulence modelling; turbulence simulation        ,"(We develop a generalised unsteady plume theory and compare it with a new direct numerical simulation (DNS) dataset for an ensemble of statistically unsteady turbulent plumes. The theoretical framework described in this paper generalises previous models and exposes several fundamental aspects of the physics of unsteady plumes. The framework allows one to understand how the structure of the governing integral equations depends on the assumptions one makes about the radial dependence of the longitudinal velocity, turbulence and pressure. Consequently, the ill-posed models identified by Scase & Hewitt (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 697, 2012, pp. 455-480) are shown to be the result of a non-physical assumption regarding the velocity profile. The framework reveals that these ill-posed unsteady plume models are degenerate cases amongst a comparatively large set of well-posed models that can be derived from the generalised unsteady plume equations that we obtain. Drawing on the results of DNS of a plume subjected to an instantaneous step change in its source buoyancy flux, we use the framework in a diagnostic capacity to investigate the properties of the resulting travelling wave. In general, the governing integral equations are hyperbolic, becoming parabolic in the limiting case of a 'top-hat' model, and the travelling wave can be classified as lazy, pure or forced according to the particular assumptions that are invoked to close the integral equations. Guided by observations from the DNS data, we use the framework in a prognostic capacity to develop a relatively simple, accurate and well-posed model of unsteady plumes that is based on the assumption of a Gaussian velocity profile. An analytical solution is presented for a pure straight-sided plume that is consistent with the key features observed from the DNS."

The influence of printing speed and initial ink droplet size on the ability to accurately transfer ink during the printing process is explored systematically. Smooth interface volume of fluid simulations show the same trends as the ink transfer observed in experiments over a wide range of printing speeds and for inks having different silica particle loadings. Our calculations indicate that for ink droplets with characteristic dimensions in the vicinity of 10 mu m, which are of particular interest for gravure printing applications, ink transfer improves significantly due to the diminishing effect of gravity, and the increased importance of capillary forces at small length scales.

231,MAE , Fluid mechanics  , aerodynamics; general fluid mechanics; vortex shedding        ,"A combined theoretical and experimental investigation was carried out with the objective of evaluating theoretical predictions relating to a two-dimensional airfoil subjected to high amplitude harmonic oscillation of the free stream at constant angle of attack. Current theoretical approaches were reviewed and extended for the purposes of quantifying the hound, unsteady vortex sheet strength along the airfoil chord. This resulted in a closed form solution that is valid for arbitrary reduced frequencies and amplitudes. In the experiments, the bound, unsteady vortex strength of a symmetric 18% thick airfoil at low angles of attack was measured in a dedicated unsteady wind tunnel at maximum reduced frequencies of 0.1 and at velocity oscillations less than or equal to 50%. With the boundary layer tripped near the leading edge and mid-chord, the phase and amplitude variations of the lift coefficient corresponded reasonably well with the theory. Near the maximum lift coefficient overshoot, the data exhibited an additional high-frequency oscillation. Comparisons of the measured and predicted vortex sheet indicated the existence of a recirculation bubble upstream of the trailing edge which sheds into the wake and modifies the Kutta condition. Without boundary layer tripping, a mid-chord bubble is present that strengthens during flow deceleration and its shedding produces a dramatically different effect. Instead of a lift coefficient overshoot, as per the theory, the data exhibit a significant undershoot. This undershoot is also accompanied by high-frequency oscillations that are characterized by the bubble shedding. In summary, the location of bubble and its subsequent shedding play decisive roles in the resulting temporal aerodynamic loads."

By establishing mathematical model to simulate the overall system, thermodynamic analysis and exergoeconomic analysis are conducted to examine the effects of five key parameters including the compressor pressure ratio, the compressor inlet temperature, the BC turbine inlet temperature, the ORC turbine inlet pressure and the ejector primary flow pressure on system performance. What's more, a single-objective optimization by means of genetic algorithm (GA) is carried out to search the optimal system performance from viewpoint of exergoeconomic. Results show that the increases of the BC turbine inlet temperature, the ORC turbine inlet pressure and the ejector primary flow pressure are benefit to both thermodynamic and exergoeconimic performances of the CCP system. However, the rises in compressor pressure ratio and compressor inlet temperature will lead to worse system performances.

Three different environmental impact categories are selected in order to understand the diverse effects of vehicles, namely: global warming, human toxicity and ozone layer depletion. As an alternative fuel for internal combustion engines, hydrogen and methanol, are directly utilized in internal combustion engine vehicles. The results of this study show that electric vehicles yield higher human toxicity values due to the respective manufacturing and maintenance stages.

It is applied to simulate high-pressure fuel injections in a constant volume chamber and in mixture preparation experiments in a light-duty internal combustion engine. The model is based on the Lagrangian-Particle/Eulerian-Fluid approach, and an improved blob injection model is used that removes numerical dependency on the injected number of computational parcels. Atomization is modeled with the hybrid Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor scheme, in combination with a drop drag model that includes Mach number and Knudsen number effects. A computationally efficient drop collision scheme is presented, tailored for large numbers of parcels, using a deterministic collision impact definition and kd-tree data search structure to perform radius-of-influence based, grid-independent collision probability estimations. A near-nozzle sub-grid scale flow-field representation is introduced to reduce numerical grid dependency, which uses a turbulent transient gas-jet model with a Stokes-Strouhal analogy assumption. An implicit coupling method was developed for the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) turbulent flow solver. A multi-objective genetic algorithm was used to study the interactions of the various model constants, and to provide an optimal calibration. The optimal set showed similar values of the primary breakup constants as values used in the literature. However, different values were seen for the gas-jet model constants for accurate simulations of the initial spray transient. The results show that there is a direct correlation between the predicted initial liquid-phase transient and the global gas-phase jet penetration. Model validation was also performed in engine simulations with the same set of constants. The model captured mixture preparation well in all cases, proving its suitability for simulations of transient spray injection in engines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Through an experiment study, the steady and dynamic performances of the unit are presented and analyzed for calibrating the parameters of the dynamic model. Then the model is validated by the experiment data during steady and dynamic processes. The improvement of prediction accuracy of the model by considering dynamic processes is analyzed. The validation results show that the dynamic model can well predict the characteristics of the unit during start-up, cool-down, and overheat protection control processes.

By considering the dynamic processes, 5.18% and 3.2% of Qth and eta(total) cumulative prediction errors are decreased respectively when the start stop interval is 0.5 h. The primary energy saving ratio and CO2 emission reduction ratio increases with the increase of the start stop interval.

160,MAE , Thermodynamics  , Rammasun (2014); high-resolution simulation; energetics analysis; rapid intensification        ,"A 72-h high-resolution simulation of Supertyphoon Rammasun (2014) is performed using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model. The model covers an initial 18-h spin-up, the 36-h rapid intensification (RI) period in the northern South China Sea, and the 18-h period of weakening after landfall. The results show that the model reproduces the track, intensity, structure of the storm, and environmental circulations reasonably well. Analysis of the surface energetics under the storm indicates that the storm's intensification is closely related to the net energy gain rate (epsilon (g)), defined as the difference between the energy production (P (D)) due to surface entropy flux and the energy dissipation (D (S)) due to surface friction near the radius of maximum wind (RMW). Before and during the RI stage, the epsilon (g) is high, indicating sufficient energy supply for the storm to intensify. However, the epsilon (g) decreases rapidly as the storm quickly intensifies, because the DS increases more rapidly than the P (D) near the RMW. By the time the storm reaches its peak intensity, the D (S) is about 20% larger than the P (D) near the RMW, leading to a local energetics deficit under the eyewall. During the mature stage, the P (D) and D (S) can reach a balance within a radius of 86 km from the storm center (about 2.3 times the RMW). This implies that the local P (D) under the eyewall is not large enough to balance the D (S), and the radially inward energy transport from outside the eyewall must play an important role in maintaining the storm's intensity, as well as its intensification."

The obtained nanohybrid is characterized by FT-IR, solid-state Si-29 NMR, SEM, TEM, TGA and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, and the results demonstrate the successful cross-linkage between POSS molecules, forming block-like irregular nanoparticles with a specific surface area of 42.8 m(2) g(-1). As a novel solid-phase adsorbent, cross-linked POSS nanohybrid exhibits selective adsorption properties for acidic dyes, i.e., methyl orange (MO) in the present case. The strong electrostatic interactions between MO species and the nanohybrid are the main driving forces for MO adsorption. The kinetic data are well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption isotherm studies demonstrate that the data are well fit with Langmuir model at 293 K and a maximum adsorption capacity of 237.5 mg g(-1) is obtained. Thermodynamic studies indicate that the adsorption of MO is spontaneous and exothermal, along with reduced randomness. The adsorbed MO species could be effectively recovered by using methanol/NaOH (9/1, viv, 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH) as eluent. The practical application for textile wastewater treatment demonstrates that cross-linked POSS nanohybrid appears to be a promising material in dye removal field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

476,MAE , Thermodynamics  , Foundations of quantum mechanics; Stochastic electrodynamics; Zeropoint field; Complex vector algebra        ,"A generalized Schrodinger equation containing correction terms to classical kinetic energy, has been derived in the complex vector space by considering an extended particle structure in stochastic electrodynamics with spin. The correction terms are obtained by considering the internal complex structure of the particle which is a consequence of stochastic average of particle oscillations in the zeropoint field. Hence, the generalised Schrodinger equation may be called stochastic Schrodinger equation. It is found that the second order correction terms are similar to corresponding relativistic corrections. When higher order correction terms are neglected, the stochastic Schrodinger equation reduces to normal Schrodinger equation. It is found that the Schrodinger equation contains an internal structure in disguise and that can be revealed in the form of internal kinetic energy. The internal kinetic energy is found to be equal to the quantum potential obtained in the Madelung fluid theory or Bohm statistical theory. In the rest frame of the particle, the stochastic Schrodinger equation reduces to a Dirac type equation and its Lorentz boost gives the Dirac equation. Finally, the relativistic Klein-Gordon equation is derived by squaring the stochastic Schrodinger equation. The theory elucidates a logical understanding of classical approach to quantum mechanical foundations."
659,MAE , Thermodynamics  , Model reduction; Subsurface flow; Vadose zone; Richards equation; Heterogeneous porous medium        ,"A low-dimensional model that describes both saturated and unsaturated flow processes in a single equation is presented. Subsurface flow processes in the groundwater, the vadose zone, and the capillary fringe are accounted for through the computation of aggregated hydrodynamic parameters that result from the integration of the governing flow equations from the bedrock to the land surface. The three-dimensional subsurface flow dynamics are thus described by a two-dimensional equation, allowing for a drastic reduction of model unknowns and simplification of the model parameterizations. This approach is compared with a full resolution of the Richards equation in different synthetic test cases. Because the model reduction stems from the vertical integration of the flow equations, the test cases all use different configurations of heterogeneity for vertical cross-sections of a soil-aquifer system. The low-dimensional flow model shows strong consistency with results from a complete resolution of the Richards equation for both the water table and fluxes. The proposed approach is therefore well suited to the accurate reproduction of complex subsurface flow processes."

Determining appropriately the fraction of liquid-like solid-like regions in dependence on temperature this approach allows one to achieve a satisfactory agreement between classical nucleation theory and experiment not only at relatively high temperatures but also at temperatures lower than that of the nucleation rate maximum. The model was tested successfully on several silicate glasses revealing homogeneous volume nucleation. Some other phenomena in the interplay of crystallization and glass transition are also discussed giving an independent verification of the validity of our basic assumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The solutions enlarge the theoretical background to the familiar Brinell hardness tests used in assessing strength of materials and add few new features. The new features are mainly: (i) constructing a lower-bound solution to ball indentation, (ii) a closed-form estimation of the dual bounds with any prescribed frictional shear along the indenter/solid contact, (iii) providing dual bounds to two different situations of the material response: (a) the removed material is falling off from the bulk (akin to indentation into brittle-like materials) and (b) the removed material is piled up along the indenter face (akin to indentation into ductile-like materials). The dual bound solutions of the indenting mean ball pressure for both material cases seem to capture properly well the material constrain to local plastic indentation and the effect of the interfacial friction.

The accuracy of the method however needs to be validated with the experimental tests especially for hot-rolled sections other than typical British Section (BS). Six experimental tests on beam-to-column connections have been carried out for Flush End-Plate (FEP) connections consisting of variable parameters such as thickness of end-plate, size and number of bolts, size of columns, and beams. The tests were set-up using local hot-rolled steel sections known as Perwaja Section (PS) for beams and columns instead of typical British Section (BS). The strength of materials for end-plate, column and beam sections were tested for tensile strength and used in predicting the moment resistance for component method. The moment versus rotation of the test results were plotted and compared with the moment resistance derived from component method.

The model takes into account the inclusion size, fine granular area (FGA) size, and tensile strength of materials. Then, the equivalent crack growth rate of FGA is proposed. The model is used to estimate the fatigue life and equivalent crack growth rate for a bearing steel (GCr15) of present investigation and four high-strength steels in the literature. The equivalent crack growth rate of FGA is calculated to be of the order of magnitude of 10-1410-11 m/cycle. The estimated results accord well with the present experimental results and prior predictions and experimental results in the literature. Moreover, the effect of inclusion size on fatigue life is discussed. It is indicated that the inclusion size has an important influence on the fatigue life, and the effect is related to the relative size of inclusion for FGA. For the inclusion size close to the FGA size, the former has a substantial effect on the fatigue life. While for the relatively large value of FGA size to inclusion size, it has little effect on the fatigue life."

There has been a shift in research towards integrating both concepts, considering the Internet of Things as representing the future of computing and communications. However, the efficient combination and management of heterogeneous things or devices in the ambient intelligence domain is still a tedious task, and it presents crucial challenges. Therefore, to appropriately manage the inter-connection of diverse devices in these systems requires: (1) specifying and efficiently implementing the devices (e.g., as services); (2) handling and verifying their heterogeneity and composition; and (3) standardizing and managing their data, so as to tackle large numbers of systems together, avoiding standalone applications on local servers. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a platform to manage the integration and behavior-aware orchestration of heterogeneous devices as services, stored and accessed via the cloud, with the following contributions: (i) we describe a lightweight model to specify the behavior of devices, to determine the order of the sequence of exchanged messages during the composition of devices; (ii) we define a common architecture using a service-oriented standard environment, to integrate heterogeneous devices by means of their interfaces, via a gateway, and to orchestrate them according to their behavior; (iii) we design a framework based on cloud computing technology, connecting the gateway in charge of acquiring the data from the devices with a cloud platform, to remotely access and monitor the data at run-time and react to emergency situations; and (iv) we implement and generate a novel cloud-based IoT platform of behavior-aware devices as services for ambient intelligence systems, validating the whole approach in real scenarios related to a specific ambient assisted living application."

The soft soil and the encased columns were instrumented to measure surface settlements, excess pore pressure, surface vertical stresses, and radial deformation of the geotextile encasement. Stress concentration and the difference in settlement between the top of the encased columns and the soft soil were studied. Results showed that the differential settlement increased as the embankment height increased and when the excess pore pressure was being dissipated. Due to soil arching, the vertical stress supported by the encased column was over two times greater than the stress transmitted to the soft soil. Also, vertical stress on the encased column increased as consolidation progressed, whereas it did not vary significantly on the soft soil. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Alkalinity was observed to be reduced by 44% after geotextile bag and 77% after wetlands. In one day (24 h) waste flush cycle, COD was reduced by 72% after geotextile bag and further reduced by 95% after zeolite treatment followed by constructed wetland. When wastewater was passed through geotextile bag, 71% reduction of COD occurred during 96 h flush cycle and further reduction of 87% was observed after zeolite.

The dyke was used to enclose a polder in Hamburg-Finkenwerder, Germany. With the help of geotextile, the columns can be used in very soft soils, even undrained shear strength c(u) < 15 kN/m(2), without excessive bulging. After the system is installed, the dike can be filled immediately. To analysis observed data of the long-term settlements in the dyke, three stages can be gotten i.e. ""Primary settlements"" - ""Secondary settlements"" - ""Creep settlements"". Most settlements occurred during the primary filling, while, only little settlements appeared after that construction was accomplished. The settlement rate decreases from the first settlement stage to the last one. No jump takes place when unloading soft soil. Furthermore, the method shorten time and saved a lot of money."

The behaviour of the improved foundation was monitored by means of instrumentation with respect to surface settlements, excess pore pressures, total vertical stresses acting on the top of the encased column and surrounding soft soil as well as geotextile radial deformation. Two-dimensional finite-element analysis was performed using an axi-symmetric unit cell, and then the results were compared with field measurements. It was observed that the soil arching progressed during post-construction due to a decrease in apparent stiffness of soft clay from quasi undrained to drained stiffness. Furthermore, there was a difference in settlement between the top of the encased column and the surrounding soft soil, midpoint between the columns, which increased during both construction and consolidation stages. A measured relation was also found to correlate the geotextile expansion with the maximum settlement occurring below the embankment."

The fuzzy logic model was developed to address issues of soil erosion risk with constant rainfall intensity. Two simple and efficient fuzzy logic soil erosion models were developed, of which one was for predicting soil erosion intensity (fuzzy-soil erosion model, or F-SEM) and the other was for selecting an appropriate CG type for soil erosion control based on types of soil in various combinations of slope angle and length, crop cover, rainfall intensity, and so forth (fuzzy-CG model, or F-CGM). These two models were developed in such a way that the input data requirement was the minimum for model execution. The considered input parameters were the main primary governing factors that influence soil erosion intensity in the USLE platform. F-SEM and F-CGM was compared with actual field data and found to be very closely matching. F-SEM predicts the erosion intensity of an area, and F-CGM can be used in the selection of CGs for erosion control application. (c) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers."

As of August 10th the local media had reported the death of three people, over 200 people injured, over 950 habitants evacuated, and 50 houses damaged. This study presents the preliminary results of the assessment of several spectral indices to evaluate the burn severity of Madeira fires during August 2016. These spectral indices were calculated using the new European satellite Sentinel-2A launched in June 2015. The study confirmed the advantages of several spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIreXn) using red-edge spectral bands to assess the post-fire conditions. Results showed high correlation between NDVI, GNDVI, NBR and NDVIreln spectral indices and the analysis performed by Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMSR175), considered as the reference truth. Regarding the red-edge spectral indices, the NDVIreln (using band B5, 705 nm) presented better results compared with B6 (740 nm) and B7 (783 nm) bands. These preliminary results allow us to assume that Sentinel-2 will be a valuable tool for post-fire monitoring. In the future, the two twin Sentinel-2 satellites will offer global coverage of the Madeira Archipelago every five days, therefore allowing the simultaneous study of the evolution of the burnt area and reforestation information with high spatial (up to 10 m) and temporal resolution (5 days).

A conventional decision tree algorithm with multiple threshold tests was employed to analyze radiances for the five spectral bands available across the full analysis period. The accuracies of the analyzed SCE maps were evaluated against in-situ snow data measured at ground stations along with the SCE maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) product. The evaluation showed the JASMES product to have a more temporally stable producer's accuracy (PA; 1-omission error) than NOAA, which is a key factor in the analysis of long-term SCE trends. Comparison of seasonal NH SCE trends from the two products showed NOAA to have opposite trends to those of JASMES in the fall and winter seasons, and to have overestimated SCE decreasing trends in the spring and summer. These tendencies are consistent with the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of information over time, which were used in generating the NOAA snow analysis. An estimation of unbiased SCEs based on the accuracies of SCE maps also endorses the long-term trends of the JASMES product The JASMES NH seasonal SCE exhibited negative slopes in all seasons but was only statistically significant in the summer (JJA) and fall (SON). Delayed snow cover onset was observed to be the main driver of decreasing annual snow duration (SCD) trends. The spatial pattern of annual SCD trends exhibited noticeable asymmetry between continents, with the largest significant decreases observed over western Eurasia with relatively few statistically significant decreases over North America.

It is demonstrated that the boundary of this transition, called the causal surface, is sufficiently localized. The position of the causal surface depends on the chosen radiation frequency. The skin layer in media with strong absorption is formed at the boundary of the causal surface, and this can be used for depth sensing of such media."

This method takes advantage of local correlations in the data-space to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed deep velocities. No assumptions regarding the structure of the water column, nor the underlying dynamics of the flow field, are made. Using satellite observations of surface velocity, sea-surface height and sea-surface temperature, as well as observations of the deep current velocity from autonomous Argo floats to train the map, we are able to reconstruct realistic high-resolution velocity fields at a depth of 1000 m. Validation reveals promising results, with a speed root mean squared error of similar to 2.8 cm.s(-1), more than a factor of two smaller than competing methods, and direction errors consistently smaller than 30 degrees. Finally, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of this methodology."

The model is built on a fitness function that computes the difference between the observed results produced from remote-sensing images and the simulated results produced by a general CA model. GPS optimization incorporating genetic algorithms (GAs) searches for the minimum difference, i.e. the smallest accumulated residuals, in fitting the CA transition rules. The CA coefficients captured by the GPS method have clear physical meanings that are closely associated with the dynamic mechanisms of land-use change. The GPS-CA model was applied to simulate urban land-use change in Kunshan City in the Yangtze River Delta from 2000 to 2015. The results show that the GPS method had a smaller root mean squared error (0.2821) than a logistic regression (LR) method (0.5256) in fitting the CA transition rules. The GPS-CA model thus outperformed the LR-CA model, with an overall accuracy improvement of 4.7%. As a result, the GPS-CA model should be a superior tool for modeling land-use change as well as predicting future scenarios in response to different conditions to support the sustainable urban development."

The stochastic nature of precipitation dominates water balance of rainwater harvesting systems, and the theory of stochastic control better serves for determining optimal strategies for water management. A mathematical model consisting of stochastic differential equations, with few model parameters that can be identified from observed data, is developed to describe dynamics of rainwater harvesting systems for irrigation. Stochastic control problems are formulated and then solved to obtain the optimal irrigation strategies during dry spells. This procedure can be inversely applicable to designing dimensions of a system. Identification of the model parameters is demonstrated with the data observed in an experimental micro rainwater harvesting system in Japan as well as in semiarid savanna of Ghana. Then, a real life application is discussed in the context of the Jordan Rift Valley, where a rainwater harvesting system will be developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
489,Civil , Rainwater Harvesting  , Drought risk management; Non-parametric composite indicators; Global; Hazard; Exposure; Vulnerability        ,"A global map of drought risk has been elaborated at the sub-national administrative level. The motivation for this study is the observation that little research and no concerted efforts have been made at the global level to provide a consistent and equitable drought risk management framework for multiple regions, population groups and economic sectors. Drought risk is assessed for the period 20002014 and is based on the product of three independent determinants: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Drought hazard is derived from a non-parametric analysis of historical precipitation deficits at the 0.5; drought exposure is based on a non-parametric aggregation of gridded indicators of population and livestock densities, crop cover and water stress; and drought vulnerability is computed as the arithmetic composite of high level factors of social, economic and infrastructural indicators, collected at both the national and sub-national levels. The performance evaluation of the proposed models underlines their statistical robustness and emphasizes an empirical resemblance between the geographic patterns of potential drought impacts and previous results presented in the literature. Our findings support the idea that drought risk is driven by an exponential growth of regional exposure, while hazard and vulnerability exhibit a weaker relationship with the geographic distribution of risk values. Drought risk is lower for remote regions, such as tundras and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and regions extensively exploited for crop production and livestock farming, such as South-Central Asia, Southeast of South America, Central Europe and Southeast of the United States. As climate change projections foresee an increase of drought frequency and intensity for these regions, then there is an aggravated risk for global food security and potential for civil conflict in the medium- to long-term. Since most agricultural regions show high infrastructural vulnerability to drought, then regional adaptation to climate change may begin through implementing and fostering the widespread use of irrigation and rainwater harvesting systems. In this context, reduction in drought risk may also benefit from diversifying regional economies on different sectors of activity and reducing the dependence of their GDP on agriculture.

Soil and water conservation measures, with the active participation of local inhabitants, included the construction and renovation of ponds, jalkunds (micro rainwater-harvesting structures) and bench and half-moon terraces. Impact analysis revealed that 4.3 million litres of water were harvested and enhanced potato and rice crop productivity by 30% to 40% and 45% to 50% respectively.

Overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the Malaysian recreational water quality Class BB standards with exceptions for pH (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). A large number of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and Chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in Malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. Mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. Rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. Last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. The results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. Both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

The project is to develop an irrigation scheme near the Dead Sea, where low annual precipitation and high salinity are the major concerns. The scheme consists of an irrigated farm, a reservoir, and an intake structure to divert ephemeral flood flows into the reservoir. The harvested water is expected to be fresh in comparison with the groundwater in the vulnerable freshwater lens. This research focusses on hydraulic design and actual construction processes of the structure. The structure consists of a gutter cutting across a 16 m wide valley bottom and a conveyance channel of 60 m long to guide the water into the reservoir. The conveyance channel is equipped with a spillway part. As a result of level surveys and hydrological considerations, it was revealed that the structure should have a width of 1.6 m and supercritical flows should be dominant. Details of structure dimensions were designed with numerical and model experiments. A finite volume scheme for the two-dimensional shallow water equations was used to numerically reproduce the whole flow field during a rainwater harvesting event with the maximum design discharge. The numerical scheme employs special fluxsplitting and data reconstruction techniques that realize stable computation of very shallow transcritical flows. A distorted hydraulic model with 1/8 horizontal scale and 1/1 roughness scale was constructed in an experimental station in Japan, in order to test hydraulic phenomena that the numerical method cannot represent. Then, the structure was actually constructed at the site. The channel bottoms are made of reinforced concrete, while the side walls are of concrete blocks whose sizes have been chosen according to the design. However, minor changes were made during the construction processes due to workability constraints. The numerical experiments were conducted again to confirm the actual structure showing desired performance."

Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts. 2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened. 3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable. 4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use. 5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them. Oil, mainly attributed by leaky motor tourist boats, is the major organic pollutants in the lake water, with 10 samples (37.04%) showing higher oil content than the permissible limit. The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view. Accelerating the circulation and replenishment of the lake water is an important way of reducing contaminant concentrations. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on lake water quality for decision makers and valuable reference for international lake water researchers."

However, all fertilizer must be applied in a single basal dose before the soil surface is covered by plastic film in GCRPS resulting in excessive vegetative crop growth and nitrogen deficiency during the reproductive stage. Furthermore, a severe drawback of GCRPS is soil and water pollution from residuals polyethylene film used for ground cover. A two-year field experiment was conducted using biodegradable film together with treatments comparing all basal application of N with application of N as three splits and a single basal fertilization of urea plus manure. We examined N uptake and crop growth from transplanting harvest, rice grain yield, yield components, dynamics of tillers and shoot dry matter, and N recovery efficiency. Compared to basal application of all N fertilizer in GCRPS, split application of N or a basal combination of urea plus manure in conjunction with the use of biodegradable film 1) significantly increased rice grain yield, number of productive tillers, and spikelets per square meter; 2) improved crop growth rate and N uptake rate from panicle initiation to maturity; and 3) significantly increased agronomic efficiency of N fertilizer and recovery efficiency of N in grains. Our results highlight that using biodegradable film instead of standard plastic film allows for split application of fertilizers, which increases yield and N use efficiency as well as significantly reduce environmental pollution with plastic film in GCRPS.

A questionnaire, including the exploration of risk perception (RP) regarding environmental hazards and access to and trust in information, was administered to 282 subjects stratified by area, gender and age. The survey was designed to investigate how populations living in polluted areas could adopt prevention-oriented habits, fostered by the awareness of existing risks and, in addition, how increased knowledge of RP and information flows could support researchers in identifying recommendations, and presenting and disseminating HBM results. This study characterizes the four areas in terms of RP and access to and trust in environmental information, and provides insights into the influence of RP and environmental information on food consumption. For the data analysis, a combined random forest (RF) and logistic regression approach was carried out. RF was applied to the variables derived from the questionnaire in order to identify the most important in terms of the aims defined. Associations were then tested using Fisher's exact test and assessed with logistic regression in order to adjust for confounders. Results showed that the perception of and personal exposure to atmospheric and water pollution, hazardous industries and waste, hazardous material transportation and waste was higher in geographical areas characterized by anthropogenic pollution. Citizens living in industrial areas appeared to be aware of environmental risks and had more confidence in environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) than in public authorities. In addition, they reported an insufficient circulation of information. Concerning the influence of RP and environmental information on food consumption, a high perception of personal exposure to atmospheric pollution and hazardous industries was associated with a lower consumption of local fish. In conclusion, different RPs and information flow patterns were observed in areas with arsenic of natural origin or in industrial contexts. These findings may be useful for targeted risk communication plans in support of risk management strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This was achieved by studying monitored data from the bridge collected by accelerometers and strain gauges attached to the stay cables, as well as two robotic total stations that measured the deflection of the mid-span and the sway of the tower saddle. These results were subsequently compared to the response predicted by a finite element (FE) model of the bridge, indicating an accurate match.

Based on recorded wind data, the measured spectra expression is presented using the nonlinear least-squares regression method. Turbulent winds at the bridge site are simulated based on the spectral representation method and the FFT technique. The influence of some key structural parameters and measures on the dynamic characteristics of the bridge are investigated. These parameters include dead load intensity, as well as vertical, lateral and torsional stiffness of the steel box girder. In addition, the influence of elastic stiffness of the connection device employed between the towers and the girder on the vibration mode of the steel box girder is investigated. The analysis shows that all of the vertical, lateral and torsional buffeting displacement responses reduce gradually as the dead load intensity increases. The dynamic characteristics and the structural buffeting displacement response of the SCB are only slightly affected by the vertical and torsional stiffness of the steel box girder, and the lateral and torsional buffeting displacement responses reduce gradually as the lateral stiffness increases. These results provide a reference for dynamic analysis and design of super-long-span cable-stayed bridges."

The stiffness of central buckle has a great influence on the vibration of main cable, while compared with only setting short hanger cable, the vibration of main cable increases 7.32% while setting the rigid central buckle.

In this paper, the vibration responses of the bridge under a series of excitation conditions are examined to estimate the wind and traffic-induced variations of its dynamic characteristics. Firstly, two output-only experimental modal identification methods are selected. Secondly, the bridge and its monitoring system are described and the nineteen sets of vibration records are analyzed in time-domain and frequency-domain. Excitations sources of blind datasets are predicted based on the analysis of excitation conditions of known datasets. Thirdly, modal parameters are extracted by using the two selected output-only modal identification methods. The identified modal parameters are examined with respect to at least two different conditions such as traffic- and typhoon-induced loadings. Finally, the typhoon-induced effects on dynamic characteristics of the bridge are estimated by analyzing the relationship between the wind velocity and the modal parameters."

A popular VIV model (Van der Pol-type model) for bridge decks is examined in detail. Alternatively, a truncated Volterra series-based nonlinear oscillator is introduced to model the VIV system. Typical features of VIV such as the limit cycle oscillation (LCO), frequency shift, hysteresis, and beat phenomenon are parsimoniously and accurately captured in the proposed nonlinear model. As a functional expansion of a nonlinear system, the Volterra series is convenient for estimating the linear and nonlinear contributions to VIV. It is demonstrated that the relative contribution of nonlinear effects in VIV is around 50% of the total response for a range of bridge cross sections. The efficacy of the Volterra series as a reduced-order model (ROM) in capturing aerodynamic nonlinearities eliminates the need for reliance on conventional phenomenological models as it promises to offer a unified framework for nonlinear wind effects on long-span bridgesfor example, VIV, buffeting, and flutter.

This novel structure contains several layers of randomly displaced metal patches and layers are spaced by a quarter wavelength. Specular reflection at normal incidence is suppressed by the phase cancellation technique. The reduction bandwidth is broadened by setting the layer surface area ratio based on binomial coefficients. Because the structure contains no absorbent material, metal surfaces are divided into small patches and displaced randomly to avoid reflection peaks beyond the boresight direction. The RCS reduction effect is validated via measurements in a far-field antenna range. Parametric studies and detailed discussions about this technique are conducted using simulation results computed from full-wave numerical tools, which include not only the specular reflection but also contributions from higher order scattering mechanisms.

The absorption rate of the absorber is obtained by software High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) 14.0. The relative bandwidth for the absorption rate above 90% is 27.1%, from 134 GHz to 176 GHz.

A multilayered patch-grid-patch-type FSS consisting of copper layers as capacitive or inductive surfaces and a glass/epoxy prepreg as the substrate is produced. It operates at 9-10 GHz for dual polarisation. This technique can be used to manufacture a stealth technology for communicating in a specific frequency range.

The camouflage characteristics of the coated fabric with paint mixed with MAS, binder and other auxiliary in the thermal infrared (IR 8 similar to 14 mu m) and the optical (0.38 similar to 1.2 mu m) region, was studied by emissivity tester, visible light camera and thermal infrared imager. The results show that the MAS pigment has low emissivity and optical camouflage effectiveness compared with the Al/SiO2 pigment. Particularly, the MAS pigment is in green by depositing metal oxide, ferrocyanide and pure metal on the surface of Al/SiO2. The optical reflectance spectrum of coated fabric was similar to the natural grass. Furthermore, the surface emissivity of the coated fabric reached 0.51 in the IR region. The thermography of the coated fabric with 4 wt% MAS was similar to the natural grass. It can conclude that the coated fabric can perfectly imitate grass background."

INTRODUCTION Sustainability has been defined as the need to preserve existing natural resources so that the earth is able to continue to provide these resources for future generations. Put more simply, a sustainable system is one that survives or persists (Costanza and Patten, 1995). In order to ensure the sustainability of architectural and building activity, it is essential that work in this field is conducted in accordance with the canons of basic ecology and, in addition, that its members seek to address certain cultural and relational characteristics that typify the way we live today. Architecture as a discipline combines technology and art; however, with the advent of ""sustainable architecture"" additional concepts from the fields of ecology, sociology, and philosophy have been incorporated. Yet, the fundamental problem is that the meanings of both the classical and the new concepts remain ambiguous, their significance shifting with our cultural evolution. Hence, the traditional Vitruvian values of architecture (beauty, structure and utility) are no longer so obvious, especially when we are required to think in terms of sustainability. Although the question as to why architecture matters has been answered in a variety of ways (Glaeser, 2011), it is our contention that in the 21st century architecture will matter more than ever, because by 2050 most of the world's population will be concentrated in cities. As a result, the sustainability of dwellings and cities has acquired undeniable importance. Two interacting forces influence all populations. One is the Malthusian dynamic of exponential growth until environmental limits are reached (Figure 1). The second is the Darwinian dynamics of innovation and adaptation that circumvent these limits through biological or cultural evolution. Nekola et al., in 2013 reported that the specific manifestation of these two forces in our current society provide the context that establishes how humans may develop sustainable relationships within our finite planet (Figure 2). Consequently, a permanent and indefinite growth is impossible due to the physical and biological imperatives of our finite world. Biologists and architects and constructors usually inhabit different worlds. The latter innovate, deploy, and apply their techno-science based designs; the first, study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable? In other words, this study aims to elucidate the essence of sustainability in green building design implementation."

INTRODUCTION The emergence of environmental problems as major social issues throughout the world has prompted sustainable development efforts in a wide range of areas, including industry, construction, and transportation, followed by the execution of numerous studies and policies. The concept of sustainable development has been dealt with in earnest in the construction field since the Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future at the 18th Chicago Convention of UIA in 1993. This Declaration included tasks to be implemented with respect to green buildings, such as the recycling of resources, application of energy-efficient designs, and utilization of natural energy in addition to the application of sustainable designs. As part of green building practices, countries around the world have been implementing various green building certification standards, such as LEED, GBCC, CASBEE, and BREEAM. These certification standards prescribe the criteria relating to the external environment, energy conservation, materials and resources, and the indoor environment, with energy conservation being the top priority for each of these issues. This is due to energy consumption in building operation accounting for more than half of the building life cycle cost. Accordingly, although many studies are undertaken for the purpose of developing the means for conserving energy in relation to green buildings, the majority of these studies are concentrated on the development of technologies for environmental facilities through the application of active designs. study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable?

In two-stage bubble pump driven lithium bromide absorption refrigeration system, flow patterns in lifting pipe have significant effects on the performance of bubble pump. In this paper, the single bubble motion and the double bubbles coalescence in vertical ascending pipe are simulated by an improved free energy model of lattice Boltzmann method, in which the two-phase liquid to gas density ratio is 2778. The details of bubbles coalescence process are studied. Density and velocity of bubbles have been obtained. The computational results show that the initial radius of each bubble has a great influence on the coalescence time. The larger the initial bubble radius, the shorter the coalescence time. The pipe diameter has a little effect on the two bubbles coalescence time while it has a significant effect on the bubble velocity. As the pipe diameter increases, the bubble velocity increases. The obtained results are helpful for studying the transition mechanisms of two-phase flow patterns and useful for improving the bubble pump performance by controlling the flow patterns in lifting pipe.

The storage unit is made of inert honeycomb supports (cordierite) coated with 88 kg of redox active material (cobalt oxide). An experimental campaign has been carried out consisting of 22 thermochemical charge-discharge cycles. The heat absorbed or released by the chemical reaction became clearly evident through the temperature evolution inside the reactive material. It allows to store or release energy at constant temperature when crossing respectively the reduction/oxidation temperature of the Co3O4/CoO pair. A storage performance factor (P-F) was defined to evaluate how each experiment approaches the ideal behavior. During the complete campaign no measurable cycle-to-cycle degradation was observed and the system average capacity was very close to the ideal case of P-F = 0.84. The advantage of thermochemical storage could be quantified by comparing the storage capacity, to that of a sensible-only storage unit made of uncoated cordierite honeycombs. The thermochemical system offered almost double storage capacity (47.0 kW h) cf. the same volume of the sensible-only case (25.3 kW h). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

This means that a large part of a worker's health and wellbeing could depend on the construction site and its environs. Construction work, which is inherently stressful due to the ever present threat of fatalities and injuries, compromises the ergonomic reality and human sustenance on construction sites. This necessitates the need to create a beneficial and comfortable environment that is motivational, inspirational, and healing. The biophilic construction site model (BCSM) which involves methodology of 'greening construction sites', is proposed as a healthy means of tapping into the natural resources of the construction site environment. It is intended to create a comfort zone on the construction site that would generate a symbiotic benefit to enhance its humanistic value and engender the health and wellbeing and creative performance of workers. The paper reports on a case study in the form of a focus group study and a comparative analysis of two similar construction sites in the Northern Cape region of South Africa. The findings present the healthy inter-nurture existing between a living construction site and its human occupants as a cost effective psychotherapeutic intervention in sustainable sites initiative and ergonomics, which according to research findings is as of yet missing in the construction management body of knowledge (CMBOK).

However, the CPM method lacks flexibility in handling uncertainties and options, a desirable feature in managing complex programs. This paper proposes a new scheduling method that is drawn from the authors' experiences of managing a large-scale construction program-the Shanghai Expo facility construction. The new method is developed on the basis of the traditional CPM method but is able to incorporate options and importance levels into the program schedule.

Unfortunately, location adjustment factors are not available for all locations. To overcome this lack of data, cost estimators in the United States often use adjustment factors from adjacent locations, referred to as the nearest neighbor (NN) method. However, these adjacent locations may not have similar economic conditions, which limit the accuracy of the NN method. This research proposes a new method of using nighttime light satellite imagery (NLSI) to estimate location adjustment factors where they do not exist. The NLSI method for estimating location adjustment factors was evaluated against an established cost index database, and results show that NLSI can be used to effectively estimate location adjustment factors. When compared with NN and other alternative proximity-based location adjustment methods, the proposed NLSI method leads to a 25-40% reduction of the median absolute error. This work contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a more accurate method for estimating location adjustment factors which can improve cost estimates for construction projects where location adjustment factors do not currently exist.

The plans were valid for fifty years in the management of the city's urban development. They find their origins in Karl Brunner's studies and proposals between 7929 and 7932 and in the draft project that made them possible during his second stay in 1934, which Robert Humeres finally developed in the five coming years. The problem we approach in this article is, therefore, related to the capacity of this cartography to contain a specific idea of ""modern city"". In fact, the thesis of this article is that the Official Plan gives an account of both, an existing city, rigorously registered, and a new one arising as a product of its transformation according to the indications represented on it. In this double intentionality underlies, from our point of view, a clearly ""modern"" bias, evidenced in both the willingness for understanding the new that comes from the pre-existent phenomenon, as the necessary abstraction its representation should achieve to allow both worlds to cohabitate in the plan. This observation is confirmed when we prove the plan is configured from three types of lines that synthetize the complexity of the public space."

In this study, the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) was adopted and modified to assist in classifying the root causes of fatal FFH accidents in Hong Kong. The characteristics and root causes of the accidents were analyzed using frequency analysis. The associations among the causes were examined using Fisher's exact test and latent class analysis (LCA). The cases apparently share some common characteristics and certain HFACS factors are closely associated. According to LCA results, the factors in all the cases may be placed into four classes, named as ill planning, violation, hidden hazards created by others, and incapable staffing. Recommendations are made to reduce FFH construction accidents based on the characteristics and root causes. The paper contributes to the body of knowledge in construction management by developing a modified HFACS framework for extracting structured information from construction accident reports, finding the general characteristics and managerial causes behind the FFH accidents, and using LCA to identify the connections among the managerial causes."

To reveal the significant importance and smart-material functionality of the energetic-energetic co-crystals, the stability, mechanical and explosive properties TNT/CL-20 co-crystal, TNT crystal and CL-20 crystal were studied. Non-hydrogen bonded non-covalent interactions govern the structures of energetic-energetic co-crystals. However, it is very difficult to accurately calculate the non-covalent intermolecular interaction energies. In this paper, the local conformation and the intricate non-covalent interactions were effectively mapped and analyzed from the electron density (rho) and its derivatives. The results show that the two components TNT and CL-20 are connected mainly by nitro-aromatic interactions, and nitro-nitro interactions. The steric interactions in TNT/CL-20 could not be confronted with the attractive interactions. Moreover, the scatter graph of TNT crystal reveals the reason why TNT is brittle. The detailed electrostatic potential analysis predicted that the detonation velocities (D) and impact sensitivity for the compounds both increase in the sequence of CL-20 >TNT/CL-20 co-crystal >TNT. Additionally, TNT/CL-20 co-crystal has better malleability than its pure components. This demonstrates the capacity and the feasibility of realizing explosive smart materials by co-crystallization, even if strong hydrogen bonding schemes are generally lacking in energetic materials."

Early life adversity, such as insecure attachment in childhood, has been suggested to influence oxytocin tone contributing to a condition of neurobiological vulnerability. Aim of the present study was to investigate oxytocin serum levels in abstinent heroin addicted patients, in comparison with healthy controls, and the possible correlation with co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, aggressiveness and perception of parental neglect. Eighteen (18) abstinent patients, affected by heroin use disorders, and 18 control subjects, who never used drugs or abused alcohol, were included in the study and submitted to 1) collection of a blood sample for oxytocin assay, 2) Symptoms Check List 90 for psychiatric symptoms evaluation 3) Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory to measure aggressiveness 4) Child Experience of Care and Abuse-Questionnaire to retrospectively test the perception of parental neglect. Heroin exposure extent and heroin dosages were also recorded. Oxytocin serum levels were unexpectedly significantly higher among abstinent patients affected by heroin use disorders and positively correlated with psychiatric symptoms, aggressiveness and mother neglect scores. No correlation was evidenced between oxytocin and heroin exposure extent or dosages. Our findings appear to contradict the simplistic view of oxytocin as a pro-social hormone and confirm previous evidence concerning the peptide levels direct association with aggressive behavior and mood disorders. Considering a more complex mechanism, oxytocin would increase the sensitivity to social salience cues related to contextual or inter-individual factors, promoting pro-sociality in ""safe"" conditions and, in contrast, inducing more defensive and ""anti-social"" emotions and behaviors when the social cues are interpreted as ""unsafe"". This latter condition is often characterizing the clinical history of addicted patients. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Based on recent trends, the nitrogen atom is one of the sites in the cathinone molecule being explored by designer type modifications. In this study, we designed and synthesized two new synthetic cathinones, (1) alpha-piperidinopropiophenone (PIPP) and (2) alpha-piperidinopentiothiophenone (PIVT), which have piperidine ring substituent on their nitrogen atom. Thereafter, we evaluated whether these two compounds have an abuse potential through the conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice and self-administration (SA) in rats. We also investigated whether the substances can induce locomotor sensitization in mice following 7 days daily injection and challenge. qRT-PCR analyses were conducted to determine their effects on dopamine-related genes in the striatum. PIPP (10 and 30 mg/kg) induced CPP in mice, but not PIVT. However, both synthetic cathinones were not self-administered by the rats and did not induce locomotor sensitization in mice. qRT-PCR analyses showed that PIPP, but not PIVT, reduced dopamine transporter gene expression in the striatum. These data indicate that PIPP, but not PIVT, has rewarding effects, which may be attributed to its ability to affect dopamine transporter gene expression. Altogether, this study suggests that PIPP may have abuse potential. Careful monitoring of this type of cathinone and related drugs are advocated."

Heroin addiction has a series of cognitive impairments that may be associated with BDNF. In this study, we explored the association of BDNF with cognitive function in hero-independent patients. We enrolled 86 heroin-dependent patients and 238 normal control subjects and examined their cognition by the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS) and serum BDNF levels in 2 groups. BDNF levels were significantly higher in patients than controls (P < .001). Cognitive scores of the RBANS showed that attention and language index (P < .05) were significantly lower in heroin-dependent patients than control groups. Unfortunately, we found no positive association between BDNF and cognitive function in patients, except that BDNF was positively associated with visuospatial/ constructional index in control groups. Our findings suggest that BDNF may not be involved in the pathophysiology of heroin dependence, but more studies about cognitive impairment in heroin addiction are needed."

Results showed that Internet behaviors were rated more highly when presented as complementary than when presented as competing, supporting the prediction that presentation format primes progress and commitment frameworks and leads to higher ratings of incongruent goal behavior in the progress condition. While results did not fully support the model's predictions regarding congruent goal behavior, they were in the predicted direction with small to moderate effect sizes. This study may inform clinical interventions by suggesting that individuals experiencing issues with problematic Internet usage would benefit from framing self-regulatory dilemmas in a competing format.

However, the understanding of this association for colorectal cancer (CRC) is controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis of CRC risk in individuals who had history of allergy compared to those without the history of allergic condition. Pumbed and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies. The adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were pooled using the random-effects model. Nine studies, including 775, 178 individuals, were eligible for inclusion. The pooled estimate showed no significant association between history of allergy and CRC risk (adjusted RR 1.01, 95 % CI 0.88-1.17). Subgroup analyses confirmed the neutral association stratified by tumor location (colon: n = 6 studies; adjusted RR 1.01, 95 % CI 0.81-1.25; rectum: n = 6 studies; adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.77-1.15; colorectum: n = 3 studies; adjusted RR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.70 to 1.21), sex (male: n = 4 studies; adjusted RR 0.93, 95 % CI 0.81-1.07; female: n = 6 studies; adjusted RR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.80-1.09) or by allery type (asthma: n = 5 studies; adjusted RR 1.16, 95 % CI 0.96-1.42; hay fever: n = 4 studies; adjusted RR 0.93, 95 % CI 0.86-1.03). Meta-analysis of existing evidence provides a neutral association between allergies and CRC risk. Future well-designed prospective cohort studies should be conducted to better understand this association."

Forty-eight surfers enrolled in the study and completed an initial health background survey and weekly health surveys online using Survey Monkey. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation, a regression technique, were used to identify longitudinal and correlated results. The surfers were predominately Caucasian, male, and physically active. They surfed approximately 4 h a week. Their average age was 34 years. The data indicated that the surfers were generally ""healthy,'' with a low prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Their most common health problems were allergies and asthma. During the study, 10% of the surfers reported gastrointestinal symptoms and 29% reported upper respiratory symptoms. This study suggests surfers were significantly more likely to report upper respiratory symptoms when they had a history of allergies, housemates with upper respiratory symptoms, and/or a history of previous adverse health symptoms while surfing during a ""red tide'' (an event often associated with the presence of phytoplankton toxins). Additionally, female surfers reported upper respiratory symptoms more than males."

The quantitation of residual acrylate monomers is vital as they are strong irritants and allergens, but after polymerization, are relatively inert, causing no irritation and allergies. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) hydrogels were prepared using pentaerythritol tetra-acrylate (PETRA) as UV crosslinking agent. A simple, accurate, and robust quantitation method was developed based on gas chromatographic techniques (GC), which is suitable for routine analysis of residual PETRA monomers in these hydrogels. Unreacted PETRA was initially identified using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). The quantitation of analyte was performed and validated using gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC FID). A linear relationship was obtained over the range of 0.0002%-0.0450% (m/m) with a correlation coefficient (r(2)) greater than 0.99. The recovery (>90%), intra-day precision (%RSD <0.67), inter-day precision (%RSD <2.5%), and robustness (%RSD <1.62%) of the method were within the acceptable values. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 0.0001% (m/m) and 0.0002% (m/m), respectively.

We examined local (same region) and non-local (different region) associations between these 2 aggregated proteins in 46 normal older adults using [F-18]AV-1451 (for tau) and [C-11]PiB (for A beta) positron emission tomography (PET) and 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. While local voxelwise analyses showed associations between PiB and AV-1451 tracer largely in the temporal lobes, k-means clustering revealed that some of these associations were driven by regions with low tracer retention. We followed this up with a whole-brain region-by-region (local and non-local) partial correlational analysis. We calculated each participant's mean AV-1451 and PiB uptake values within 87 regions of interest (ROI). Pairwise ROI analysis demonstrated many positive PiB AV-1451 associations. Importantly, strong positive partial correlations (controlling for age, sex, and global gray matter fraction, p <.01) were identified between PiB in multiple regions of association cortex and AV-1451 in temporal cortical ROIs. There were also less frequent and weaker positive associations of regional PiB with frontoparietal AV-1451 uptake. Particularly in temporal lobe ROIs, AV-1451 uptake was strongly predicted by NB across multiple ROI locations. These data indicate that A beta and tau pathology show significant local and non-local regional associations among cognitively normal elderly, with increased PiB uptake throughout the cortex correlating with increased temporal lobe AV-1451 uptake. The spatial relationship between A beta and tau accumulation does not appear to be specific to A beta location, suggesting a regional vulnerability of temporal brain regions to tau accumulation regardless of where AP accumulates."

Due to heterogeneous cleavage sites, a series of A beta peptides, including the major and widely studied species A beta 1-40 (A beta 40) and A beta 1-42 (A beta 42), are produced. In addition to the C-terminal heterogeneity of A beta peptides, significant amounts of N-terminal truncated (A beta 3-42) and pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta peptides (A beta pE3-42) have been identified in AD affected brains and shown to be more cytotoxic than unmodified A beta peptides. Little is known about the properties of their mixtures with A beta 42. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is here employed to investigate the interaction of N-truncated peptides with A beta 42 at different molar ratios. We highlight the critical concentration of N-truncated forms influencing the aggregation kinetics of A beta 42. We provide evidence, at residue level, that the C-terminal region of A beta 42 is the locus of transient specific interactions with highly aggregation prone N-truncated alloforms."

NMR experiments provide evidence of NF11's ability to inhibit fibril formation, primarily through interaction with the N-terminus region as well as the central hydrophobic cluster of A beta 40. NF11 has micromolar binding affinity toward both monomeric and aggregated species for efficient clearance of toxic aggregates. From these in vitro results, the future development of a next generation peptidomimetic therapeutic agent for amyloid disease may be possible."

First, we investigated the GAB2 rs2373115 variant in Asian population using 3974 AD cases and 7568 controls. To further evaluate the effect of rs2373115 in different populations, we selected 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls in European population. We used three genetic models, and found no significant heterogeneity in Asian population. A fixed effect model analysis showed no significant association between rs2373115 and AD in Asian population. There was no significant heterogeneity in the pooled East Asian and European populations. The fixed effect model analysis again showed no significant association between rs2373115 and AD in these pooled populations. Taken together, these findings suggest that GAB2 rs2373115 may contribute to AD susceptibility only in European population but not in East Asian population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, evidence is sparse for the effect of increased smoking exposure on disease outcomes or whether smoking reduction or cessation improves outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore whether a dose-response relationship exists between pack-years and disease activity and functional impairment in axSpA. Consecutive patients meeting ASAS criteria for axial SpA were recruited from a spondyloarthritis service. The associations between pack-years of smoking and: (1) disease activity (BASDAI/ASDAS), (2) spinal pain, (3) functional impairment (BASFI) and (4) inflammatory markers were explored using multivariable linear models, adjusted for age, gender and use of TNF inhibition (TNFi) therapy. Pack-years were categorised into four groups (40) and analysed with light smoking (40, beta = 2.6 (0.54, 3.56)), higher BASFI (21-40, beta = 2.1 (0.42, 4.80); >40, beta = 3.2 (0.76, 5.71)), and higher ASDAS (21-40, beta = 0.82 (0.14, 1.51)). This cross-sectional study demonstrated that smoking is associated with increased axSpA severity markers in a dose-response manner. Particular effort should be made to restrict smoking exposure early before accruing a significant number of pack-years."

Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) encompasses non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) in individuals without established radiographic changes but with other clinical/imaging axSpA features and AS in those with definite sacroiliac joint changes on pelvic X-rays. A broad consensus about the management of nr-axSpA is emerging among clinicians, but the evidence base remains open to question. To explore whether nr-axSpA and AS should be treated similarly, we examined the literature on their prevalence, natural history, disease burden, and treatment. There is strong evidence that nr-axSpA and AS are expressions of the same disease. Approximately 10% of patients with nr-axSpA will develop radiographic disease over 2 years; after >20 years, the figure may exceed 80%. Nr-axSpA patients have lower CRP and less spinal inflammation on MRI than AS patients but similar disease activity, pain, and quality-of-life impairment. Most patients with nr-axSpA manage well with conservative treatment, but a minority has severe disabling symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy has demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in nr-axSpA and AS. Current evidence does not clearly indicate that anti-TNF treatment can inhibit or limit bony progression of AS, the basis of conservative and anti-TNF treatment is control of symptoms and function. For some patients with nr-axSpA, the need for powerful treatments is as great as in some with AS; thus, treatment of axSpA should be consistent across the axSpA spectrum with anti-TNF agents being available, irrespective of radiographic change, according to the same criteria as those applied to AS."

One hundred and six extracts from 40 native Australian plant species traditionally used for the treatment of inflammation and/or to inhibit bacterial growth were investigated for their ability to inhibit the growth of a microbial trigger for ankylosing spondylitis (K. pneumoniae). Eighty-six of the extracts (81.1%) inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae. The D. leichardtii, Eucalyptus spp., K. flavescens, Leptospermum spp., M. quinquenervia, Petalostigma spp., P. angustifolium, S. spinescens, S. australe, S. forte and Tasmannia spp. extracts were effective K. pneumoniae growth inhibitors, with MIC values generally < 1000 A mu g/mL. The T. lanceolata peppercorn extracts were the most potent growth inhibitors, with MIC values as low as 16 A mu g/mL. These extracts were examined by non-biased GC-MS headspace analysis and comparison with a compound database. A notable feature was the high relative abundance of the sesquiterpenoids polygodial, guaiol and caryophyllene oxide, and the monoterpenoids linalool, cineole and alpha-terpineol in the T. lanceolata peppercorn methanolic and aqueous extracts. The extracts with the most potent K. pneumoniae inhibitory activity (including the T. lanceolata peppercorn extracts) were nontoxic in the Artemia nauplii bioassay. The lack of toxicity and the growth inhibitory activity of these extracts against K. pneumoniae indicate their potential for both preventing the onset of ankylosing spondylitis and minimising its symptoms once the disease is established."

The role of adipokines in metabolic syndrome is known and fixed. Adipokines exerting a variety of metabolic activities have contributed to the ethiopathogenesis and the consequences of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, adipokines are involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes and autoimmunity in the light of pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases. Given some evidence for the influence of adipokines in metabolic syndrome, there may be a link between CVDs and rheumatic diseases. This review provides an overview of the literature focusing on the role of adipokines in rheumatic diseases by putting special emphasis on the potential role of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, chemerin, visfatin and novel adipokines in connective tissue diseases."

However, little research attention has been afforded to the study of adverse childhood experiences (ACE; neglect, physical and sexual abuse, and witnessing violence) among immigrants in the United States. The present study, using Waves I and II data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), aims to address these gaps by comparing forms of ACE of first- and second-generation immigrants with native-born American adults in the United States. We also examined the latent structure of ACE among immigrants and conducted analyses to assess the psychiatric correlates of identified latent classes. With the exception of neglect, the prevalence of ACE was markedly higher among native-born Americans and second-generation immigrants compared with first-generation immigrants. Four latent classes were identifiedlimited adverse experience (n = 3,497), emotional and physical abuse (n = 1,262), family violence (n = 358), and global adversity (n = 246). The latter three classes evinced greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a mood, anxiety, personality, and substance use disorder, and to report violent and non-violent antisocial behavior. Consistent with prior research examining the associations between the immigrant paradox and health outcomes, results suggest that first-generation immigrants to the United States are less likely to have experienced physical and sexual abuse and witness domestic violence. However, likely due to cultural circumstances, first-generation immigrants were more likely to report experiences that are deemed neglectful by Western standards."

We aimed to describe groups of patients with COPD according to patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour following PR. 90 patients with COPD (60% male; mean age 67 +/- 8; median FEV1 47 (32-62) % pred) completed a comprehensive PR programme. A triaxial accelerometer was used to assess the time in sedentary behaviour, light activities and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Additionally, exercise capacity, quality of life, and symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed before and after PR. Six groups with different patterns of change in physical activity and sedentary behaviour were identified. The two most prevalent patterns were represented by good responders (increase in physical activity and reduction in sedentary behaviour, 34%) and poor responders (decrease in physical activity and increase in sedentary behaviour, 30%). Good responders had greater improvements in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and symptoms of depression than poor responders (P < 0.05 for all). Strong correlation was found between changes in sedentary behaviour and changes in light activities (r(s) = -0.89; P < 0.0001). Changes in 6MWD correlated fairly with changes in sedentary behaviour (r(s) = -0.26), light activities (r(s) = 0.25), and MVPA (r(s) = 0.24); P < 0.05 for all. Different patterns of change in activity levels following PR can be found in patients with COPD. Focusing on light physical activities might be a potential strategy to make patients less sedentary, but for this to be achieved prior (or at least parallel) improvements in functional capacity seem to be necessary.

Acute and repeated administration of a cannabinoid receptor synthetic agonist is capable of increasing multiple indices of noradrenergic activity. This includes cannabinoid-induced 1) increases in norepinephrine (NE) release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); 2) desensitization of cortical alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated effects; 3) activation of c-Fos in brainstem locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons; and 4) increases in anxiety like behaviors. In the present study, we sought to examine adaptations in adrenoceptor expression and function under conditions of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1r) deletion using knockout (KO) mice and compare these to wild type (WT) controls. Electrophysiological analysis of alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in mPFC slices in WT mice showed a clonidine-induced a2-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in mPFC cell excitability coupled with an increase in input resistance. In contrast, CB1r KO mice showed an alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated decrease in mPFC cell excitability. We then examined protein expression levels of alpha 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor subtypes in the mPFC as well as TH expression in the locus coeruleus (LC) of mice deficient in CB1r. Both alpha 2- and inadrenoceptors exhibited a significant decrease in expression levels in CB1r KO mice when compared to WT in the mPFC, while a significant increase in TH was observed in the LC. To better define whether the same cortical neurons express alpha 2A-adrenoceptor and CB1r in mPFC, we utilized high-resolution immunoelectron microscopy. We localized alpha 2A-adrenoceptors in a knock-in mouse that expressed a hemoagglutinin (HA) tag downstream of the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor promoter. Although the alpha 2A-adrenoceptor was often identifiedpre-synaptically, we observed co-localization of CB1r with alpha 2-adrenoceptors post-synaptically in the same mPFC neurons. Finally, using receptor binding, we confirmed prior results showing that alpha 2A-adrenoceptor is unchanged in mPFC following acute or chronic exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, but is increased, following chronic treatment followed by a period of abstinence. Taken together, these data provide convergent lines of evidence indicating cannabinoid regulation of the cortical adrenergic system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The present addendum resolves inconsistencies in outcome reporting (e.g., total scores of scales versus subscale scores) and provides information on measures that were additionally available to analyze further potential effects of the intervention. Effects in secondary outcome domains not reported in Heinrichs et al. (2014) are furthermore analyzed and reported. The original data analyses were varied using a different statistical model in this addendum. Re-analyses supported the original results, including changes in self-reported maternal and paternal positive parenting, in maternal dysfunctional parenting behavior as well as in maternal reports of child behavior. In addition, when analyzing the externalizing and internalizing dimensions, analysis revealed a statistically significant change in externalizing but not internalizing child symptoms. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcome domains. Considering important limitations in the study design [such as baseline differences at pre-assessment with mothers from intervention preschools reporting more child behavioral problems prior to introducing the intervention and predominantly non-significant effects from (a) fathers perspective, (b) teacher ratings at 1-year follow up (FU1), and (c) behavioral observations at FU1], we believe that this trial alone cannot be taken as sufficient evidence for a significant and meaningful change in child behavioral problems, which is the ultimate goal of child prevention programs. Therefore, future studies need to replicate and extend upon these results by including larger sample sizes and overcome the discussed limitations."

One theory to explain this phenomenon is a potential substitution effect of MC for opioids. This study evaluated whether this substitution effect of MC for opioids also applies to other psychoactive medications. New England dispensary members (n = 1,513) completed an online survey about their medical history and MC experiences. Among respondents that regularly used opioids, over three-quarters (76.7%) indicated that they reduced their use since they started MC. This was significantly (p < 0.0001) greater than the patients that reduced their use of antidepressants (37.6%) or alcohol (42.0%). Approximately two-thirds of patients decreased their use of anti-anxiety (71.8%), migraine (66.7%), and sleep (65.2%) medications following MC which significantly (p < 0.0001) exceeded the reduction in antidepressants or alcohol use. The patient's spouse, family, and other friends were more likely to know about their MC use than was their primary care provider. In conclusion, a majority of patients reported using less opioids as well as fewer medications to treat anxiety, migraines, and sleep after initiating MC. A smaller portion used less antidepressants or alcohol. Additional research is needed to corroborate these self-reported, retrospective, cross-sectional findings using other data sources."

Six years ago, she had been diagnosed with bronchial asthma and was treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Chest radiograph and computed tomography on admission showed infiltrates in the right middle lobe, a mass lesion in the left lower lobe, and bronchiectasis in both lower lobes. Sputum examination showed Grampositive rods with phagocytosis by neutrophils. These bacilli were identified as Nocardia otitidiscaviarum by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Therefore, she was diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis and was treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and minocycline (MINO). However, she had to discontinue these antibiotics because of severe nausea and anorexia and instead was treated with fluoroquinolone for 6 months. There was resolution of the disease thereafter. Pulmonary nocardiosis with bronchial asthma and bronchiectasis can be successfully treated with fluoroquinolone, an alternative to TMP-SMX or MINO."

The aim of this study was to investigate personality traits, salivary alpha amylase activity and the aldosterone response to psychosocial stress procedure based on public speech in atopic patients with respect to sex and the menstrual cycle (MC) phase. The study was performed in 106 subjects of both sexes, 53 atopic patients suffering from allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma or atopic dermatitis and 53 age-, sex-, the MC phase- and BMI- matched healthy controls. Substantially attenuated activity of alpha-amylase and reduced secretion of aldosterone during the psychosocial stress were observed in the whole sample of patients with atopy. Higher activity of alpha-amylase observed in the follicular compared to the luteal phase in healthy women was not present in atopic patients. In both males and females, atopy was associated with blunted cortisol response but no changes in the heart rate. Psychological characterization revealed a significantly higher trait anxiety and higher preference for avoidance-oriented coping strategy in female but not male atopic patients. These findings provide evidence that patients with atopy exhibit insufficient alpha-amylase and aldosterone responsiveness to psychosocial stress, thus suggesting decreased sympathetic activity. Potential disturbances in sex hormone status during the MC in female patients with atopy have to be considered in future research. Changes in personality traits were demonstrated in female atopic patients, but not in male patients. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

The findings for autumn and winter indicated that the differences in temperature and relative humidity (RH) between Groups A and B were not significant. The average concentrations of CO2, HCHO and acetaldehyde of Group A were lower than those of Group B. However, the average concentrations of PM2.5 and TVOCs of Group A were higher than those of Group B. In addition, the indoor PM2.5 concentrations in ten households, exceeded the upper limit of the Chinese national standard (75 mu g/m(3)) and the TVOCs concentration in two households exceeded the upper limit (600 mu g/m(3)) in winter. The average concentrations of Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) and Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP) which could harm children's health were significantly higher in the Group A household than those in that of Group B. Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Penicillium in indoor air and house dust which could have lead to children's allergy and respiratory diseases correlated with the seasonal climate variation. It was found that high-level indoor PM2.5, TVOCs, DEHP and DBP in house dust were possibly the main risk factors for children's health, with Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Penicillium possibly providing associated health risks.

The epoxide of epichlorohydrin undergoes ring-opening with amines using MgSO4 or mixed metal oxides catalysts under mild and neutral conditions to afford the corresponding beta-amino alcohols in excellent yields. Preliminary evaluation of relaxant activity of 8b-n was carried out on rat tracheal rings contracted by carbachol 1 mu M. Most of the tested compounds exhibited significantly relaxant effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Compound 8n was found to be the most active, being twofolds more potent than theophylline (positive control). This compound has the potential for development as an anti-asthma drug."

Pathogenetic studies of well characterized patient groups has allowed investigators to more precisely define the molecular pathways involved in these diseases. Specific cytokines and chemokines, as well as other unique proteins, have now been identified in each of these common disorders and a number of medications are currently in development for inhibiting their actions. Continual refinement of our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases will undoubtedly yield increasingly precise, and potentially more effective, treatments."

Among these compounds, small interfering RNA and antisense oligonucleotides have attracted considerable attention. Antisense oligonucleotides are synthetic single stranded strings of nucleic acids that bind to RNA and thereby alter or reduce expression of the target RNA while siRNAs, on the other hand, are double-stranded RNA molecules which can hybridize with a specific mRNA sequence and block the translation of numerous genes. One of the main obstacles in the dermal or transdermal delivery of these compounds is their low skin permeability. In this review, various techniques used to enhance the delivery of these molecules into or across the skin are described and in some cases, the correlation between enhanced dermal/transdermal delivery and therapeutic efficacy is highlighted.

The aim of this randomized, single-blinded, exploratory study was to evaluate the counter-irritation effects of cold-stimulation and topical application of transient receptor potential TRPA1/M8-agonists (trans-cinnamaldehyde/Lmenthol, respectively), on histamine-induced itch, wheals and neurogenic inflammation in 13 healthy volunteers. Histamine 1% was applied to the volar forearms using skin prick-test lancets. Recorded outcome-parameters were itch intensity, wheal reactions, and neurogenic inflammation (measured by laser-speckle perfusion-imaging). Homotopic thermal counter-irritation was performed with 6 temperatures, ranging from 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C, using a 3 x 3-cm thermal stimulator. Chemical ""cold-like"" counter-irritation was conducted with 40% L-men-thol and 10% trans-cinnamaldehyde, while 5% doxepin was used as a positive antipruritic control/comparator. Cold counter-irritation stimuli from 4 degrees C to 22 degrees C inhibited itch in a stimulus-intensitydependent manner (p < 0.05) and, to a lesser extent, also wheal reactions and neurogenic inflammation. Chemical ""cold-like"" counter-irritation with both Lmenthol and trans-cinnamaldehyde had antipruritic efficacy similar to doxepin (p < 0.05). Cold-induced counter-irritation had an inhibitory effect on histaminergic itch, suggesting that agonists of cold transduction receptors could be of potential antipruritic value."

The aim of this review was to evaluate these biomarkers on their diagnostic and/or predictive value. To this date, no single or specific biomarker for allergy has been identified. As allergy is not one disease, but a collection of a number of allergic conditions, it is more plausible a combination of clinical history, clinical readouts, and diagnostic markers will be needed."
767,Medical , Atopic Dermatitis  , mixed external preparation; magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative T-2 map; emulsion stability        ,"A moisturizing cream mixed with a steroid ointment is frequently prescribed to patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. However, there is a concern that the mixing operation causes destabilization. The present study was performed to investigate the stability of such preparations closely using magnetic resonance imaging (MR1). As sample preparations, five commercial moisturizing creams that are popular in Japan were mixed with an ointment base, a white petrolatum, at a volume ratio of 1:1. The mixed preparations were stored at 60 degrees C to accelerate the destabilization processes. Subsequently, the phase separations induced by the storage test were monitored using MR1. Using advanced MR technologies including spin spin relaxation time (T-2) mapping and MR spectroscopy, we successfully characterized the phase-separation behavior of the test samples. For most samples, phase separations developed by the bleeding of liquid oil components. From a sample consisting of an oil-in-water-type cream, Urepearl Cream 10%, a distinct phase-separation mode was observed, which was initiated by the aqueous component separating from the bottom part of the sample. The resultant phase separation was the most distinct among the test samples. To investigate the phase separation quantitatively and objectively, we conducted a histogram analysis on the acquired T-2 maps. The water-in-oil type creams were found to be much more stable after mixing with ointment base than those of oil-in-water type creams. This finding strongly supported the validity of the mixing operation traditionally conducted in pharmacies."

The model utilises a tape stripping procedure in dermatomed pig skin that removes a specific proportion of the stratum corneum, mimicking impaired barrier function observed in humans with damaged skin. The skin penetration and distribution of chemicals with differing physicochemical properties, namely; Benzoic acid, 3-Aminophenol, Caffeine and Sucrose has been assessed in this model. Although, skin penetration over 24 h differed for each chemical, compromising the skin did not alter the shape of the time course profile, although absorption into receptor fluid was higher for each chemical. Systemic exposure (receptor fluid, epidermis and dermis), was marginally higher in compromised skin following exposure to the fast penetrant, Benzoic acid, and the slow penetrant Sucrose. The systemically available dose of 3-Aminophenol increased to a greater extent and the absorption of Caffeine was more than double in compromised skin, suggesting that Molecular Weight and Log P-ow are not the only determinants for assessing systemic exposure under these conditions. Although further investigations are required, this in vitro model may be useful for prediction of dermal route exposure under conditions where skin barrier is impaired. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Symptoms resolved almost immediately, and his initial troponin was negative. He underwent cardiac CT angiography utilizing an emergency room triage protocol which resulted in a diagnosis of nonobstructive coronary artery disease and apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Following a hospital stay of less than 24hours, he was discharged to outpatient follow-up on medical management and has remained asymptomatic over 6months.

A protocol was designed to allow for a rigorous, yet pragmatic evaluation of a 12-week INR follow-up interval. Feasibility was determined by study enrollment, retention, and participant achievement rates for the extended INR interval. Safety was determined by bleeding and thromboembolism rates. Participants were monitored for 6 months. Despite the long-term stability of participants prior to enrollment, only 56% achieved a 12-week follow-up interval and only 34% of enrolled participants maintained a 12-week interval. Sixteen percent of participants were never eligible for an extension of their INR follow-up interval despite meeting initial enrollment criteria. There were two major bleeding events and one participant who experienced a thromboembolic event. Implementation of an extended interval of INR follow-up appears feasible as participant enrollment goals were met and pharmacists were able to follow the study protocol. However, a lower than expected proportion of participants were able to achieve and maintain an extended INR follow-up interval. Future evaluations are needed to confirm the safety of an extended INR interval."

Fractionation of atrial electrograms may have multiple causes of both pathologic and nonpathologic origin. In order to gain insight into the definitions used for determining areas of fractionation, a literature search was performed using a systematic approach. A PubMed search for studies describing fractionation during human atrial electrophysiologic measurements resulted in 348 articles that were screened for new definitions of fractionation. The 24studies remaining after screening described 11 different visual definitions for fractionation, 3 automated complex fractionated atrial electrogram detection programs, and 7 new parameters for measuring fractionation. Five different definitions for continuous electrical activity were presented. Electrode properties were often not described, and endocardial bipolar recordings in recent studies used electrode diameters ranging from 1 to 8 mm with interelectrode distance of 2-5 mm. In summary, no uniform definition or recording method is used for measuring fractionation of cardiac atrial electrograms. The different electrophysiologic causes of fractionation and the influence of recording device properties on fractionation complicate identification of true pathologic inhomogeneous conduction. The first step in discrimination between origins of fractionation may be accomplished by relating electrogram morphology to spatial patterns of activation. Before revisiting ablation of areas with fractionated electrograms, we need to determine the correct method for identifying pathologic fractionation."

We hypothesized that transseptal puncture (TSP) at the anteroinferior aspect of the atrial septum (anteroinferior TSP) could shorten the distance to the MI and improve catheter contact and stability, enabling complete MI block. This study investigated the efficacy of anteroinferior TSP for MI ablation in AF patients. Three hundred and twenty consecutive patients (mean age: 62 +/- 9 years, 84 % male) with persistent AF undergoing AF ablation, including MI ablation, were enrolled. MI ablation was performed through the conventional (posterior) TSP site (group C, n = 170) or the anteroinferior TSP site (group A, n = 150). Left atrial diameter (LAD) enlargement was greater in group A than in group C (45.8 +/- 5.3 mm vs. 44.1 +/- 5.0 mm, p = 0.002). Complete MI block at the initial session was significantly higher in group A than in group C (141/150 [94 %] vs. 144/170 [85 %], p = 0.011). At the repeat session for AF recurrence, the rate of persistent complete MI block was significantly higher in group A than in group C (36/48 [75 %] vs. 28/67 [42 %], p < 0.001). LAD (p = 0.011) and left ventricular diastolic dimension (p = 0.037) were significant predictors of failed MI block, while anteroinferior TSP was significantly associated with successful MI block (p < 0.001). Anteroinferior TSP could improve the initial success rate and long-term persistence of complete MI block for AF ablation."
1901,Medical , Atrial Fibrillation  , Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis; Mitral stenosis; Mitral valve replacement        ,"Acute bioprosthetic valve thrombosis can occur after surgery and sometimes cause hemodynamic instability and cardiogenic shock. Risk factors for bioprosthetic valve thrombosis are hypercoagulability, atrial fibrillation, atrial dilatation, low cardiac function, and lack of anticoagulation therapy. The authors present a case of severe mitral stenosis due to bioprosthetic valve thrombus. The patient was diagnosed with dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and underwent mitral valve replacement. He required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) due to extremely low cardiac output and was scheduled for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. Transesophageal echocardiographic examination before LVAD implantation revealed severe mitral stenosis due to bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombus, which was not detected by transthoracic echocardiography in the intensive care unit and contributed to the low cardiac function. The thrombus was removed through an unscheduled left atriotomy before LVAD implantation. The possibility of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis must be considered when the patient is dependent on VA-ECMO support. Early transesophageal echocardiographic examination of the bioprosthetic valve may be helpful and contribute to surgical decision-making."

Fathers experienced strong emotion around diagnosis and were given little support. Services should support mother and fathers in ways which meet their individual needs. More positive messages should be given to families at diagnosis. AbstractBackground: A diagnosis of childhood autism can be an extremely stressful experience for parents, but little is known concerning paternal perceptions of the process. Methods: This study investigated father perspectives on a diagnosis of autism, through an online survey. Results: An analysis of 184 replies to an open-ended question identified the following themes: strong initial emotional response and a range of immediate anxieties about the future, struggle to gain a diagnosis; anger in response to insensitive delivery of diagnosis together with insufficient information at the time and lack of support afterwards. Conclusion: Fathers experienced a range of significant challenges during a diagnostic process in which most felt unsupported. Service provision should be more gender-differentiated, taking into account of the particular needs and perspectives of both mothers and fathers at this critical juncture in family life."

Using a modified Posner cueing paradigm, we replicate the previous findings of gender differences in the gaze-cueing effect whereby female but not male participants responded significantly faster to validly cued than to invalidly cued targets. In contrast to the previous studies, we report a robust cueing effect for both male and female participants when head turning direction was used as the central cue, whereas oriented bodies proved ineffectual as cues to attention for both males and females. These results are discussed with reference to the time course of central cueing effects, gender differences in spatial attention, and current models of how cues from the human body are combined to judge another person's direction of attention."

Adolescents with ASD made more categorization errors than typically developing adolescents. They also showed an age-dependent improvement in categorization speed and had more difficulties with categorizing facial expressions than gender. However, in neither of the categorization tasks, we found group differences in the processing of coarse versus fine prime information. This contradicted our expectations, and indicated that the perceptual differences between adolescents with and without ASD critically depended on the processing time available for the primes."

We used the well-established, standardized Quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol of the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain to investigate 13 somatosensory parameters including thermal and tactile detection and pain thresholds in 13 ASD adults and 13 matched healthy controls with normal IQ values. There were no group differences between somatosensory detection and pain thresholds. Two ASD patients showed paradoxical heat sensations and another two ASD subjects presented dynamic mechanical allodynia; somatosensory features that were absent in controls. These findings suggest that central mechanisms during complex stimulus integration rather than peripheral dysfunctions probably determine somatosensory alterations in ASD."

To address this problem, we evaluated the effects of a sequential model for increasing eye contact in children with ASD. The model included the following phases: contingent praise only (for eye contact), contingent edibles plus praise, stimulus prompts plus contingent edibles and praise, contingent video and praise, schedule thinning, and maintenance evaluations for up to 2 years. Results indicated that the procedures increased eye contact for 20 participants (one additional participant did not require consequences). For 16 participants, praise (alone) was not sufficient to support eye contact; however, high levels of eye contact were typically maintained with these participants when therapists used combined schedules of intermittent edibles or video and continuous praise. We discuss some limitations of this model and directions for future research on increasing eye contact for children with ASD."

TRX is induced by various oxidative stress factors, including ultraviolet rays, radiation, oxidation, viral infections, ischemia reperfusion and anticancer agents, and are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of various diseases. We have demonstrated that systemic administration and transgenic overexpression of TRX is effective in a wide variety of in vivo inflammatory disease models, such as viral pneumonia, acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indomethacin-induced gastric injury, and dermatitis. Our recent studies indicate that topically applied TRX prevents skin inflammation via the inhibition of local formation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These indicate that the activation of inflammasome in skin and mucosa may be regulated by TRX. These suggest that application of TRX may be useful for the treatment of various skin and mucosal inflammatory disorders. Based on these results, we are conducting clinical studies to develop human recombinant thioredoxin 1 (rhTRX) pharmaceuticals. We have also developed substances that increase the expression of TRX in the body (TRX-inducing substances) in vegetables and other plant ingredients, and we are also developing skin-care products and functional foods that take advantage of the anti-inflammation and anti-allergic action of TRX.

Applying an appropriate wound dressing can promote new tissue formation, prevent losing water and inhibit invasion of infectious organisms. In this study, egg white with a long standing history, as a homemade remedy, was fabricated as a wound dressing for burn injuries. For this reason, ovalbumin films were cross-linked by 1-ethyl-3-3-dimethyl aminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) with different concentrations (1,5 and 10 mM) using three concentrations of ethanol. Physical chemical characterizations including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas transmission rate (GTR), tensile mechanical tests, water uptake and degradation rate were performed on the samples. The sample with 5 mM crosslinking agent at 70% ethanol was considered as the optimized one with 417 kPa of ultimate tensile strength, 64% elongation at break and 230% water uptake. In addition, biological evaluations conducted by MTT and live/dead assay indicated no sign of cyto-toxicity for all the samples. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the fibroblast cells were well spread on the sample with the formation of filopodia. In conclusion, modified ovalbumin can be applied as the base material for fabrication of wound dressing and skin care products. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The current approach to continuing training of health-care workers uses traditional methods of centralised teaching by formal tutors away from the place of work. This is no longer affordable, achievable or desirable, particularly in rural areas. An innovative system of self-directed learning by groups of nurses caring for mothers and their newborn infants uses specially prepared course books without the need for trainers. Using self-study supported by peer discussion groups, nurses can take responsibility for their own professional growth. This builds competence, confidence and a sense of pride. Since 1993, the Perinatal Education Programme has provided continuing learning opportunities for thousands of nurses in Southern Africa. A number of prospective trials have demonstrated that study groups can significantly improve knowledge and understanding, attitudes, clinical skills and quality of care provided to mothers and infants. A recent review of 10,000 successful participants across a wide range of provinces, ages and home languages documented the success of the project. Using a question-and-answer format to promote problem-solving, case studies, simple skills workshops and multiple choice tests, each module addresses common conditions with appropriate care practices such as thorough drying at birth, delayed cord-clamping, skin-to-skin care, breast feeding, basic resuscitation, correct use of oxygen therapy, hand-washing, blood glucose monitoring and promotion of parental bonding. The training material is now also available free of charge on an on-line website as well as being presented as e-books which can be downloaded onto personal computers, tablet readers and smart phones. This is supplemented by regular SMS text messages providing nurses with relevant 'knowledge bites'. All nurses caring for newborn infants now have easy, affordable access to continuing education which promises nationwide improvements in newborn care."

The thermal stability, distribution between organic and aqueous phases, and in vitro skin permeability were evaluated. This HQ derivative was identified as disodium p-phenylene diisostearyl diphosphate (HQ-2P2IS) by UV, infrared, mass, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Product HQ-2P2IS was obtained in good yield (56%), and it exhibited satisfactory stability in neutral solution, comparable to that of HQ. Its skin permeability was also higher than that of HQ. HQ-2P2IS is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by tissue phosphatase, which releases HQ in the skin tissues. Thus, these characteristics indicate that the novel hydroquinone derivative presented herein, i.e., HQ-2P2IS, may serve as an effective pro-hydroquinone for skin care applications."

An interdigital electrode (IDE) that contacts directly with human skin is used as the sensing element. The electrode-skin model is simplified as a resistance and a capacitance in series. Using square wave signal for excitation, impedance of the IDE is measured in a charging/discharging way. During one measurement cycle, the response voltages at two excitation frequencies, i.e., 10 kHz and 600 Hz, are measured successively. Equivalent resistance and capacitance of skin are then resolved from the measured values. Both the numerical and experimental simulation results indicate that the proposed circuit and corresponding algorithms work well for resistors and capacitors. The performance of the tester is experimentally tested with human skin in cases of different status. Obvious relationship between the measured values and the skin status is observed. Moreover, distinctive results are obtained between hydrating and emollient cosmetics smeared skins. The tester can be potentially used to give a quantitative guidance for individual skin care, such as cosmetics selection."

Cross-national and cross-sectional evidence suggests that greater habitual intake of n-3 PUFA is associated with reduced risk for developing mood symptoms. Meta-analyses provide strong evidence that patients with mood disorders exhibit low blood n-3 PUFA levels which are associated with increased risk for the initial development of mood symptoms in response to inflammation. While the etiology of this n-3 PUFA deficit may be multifactorial, n-3 PUFA supplementation is sufficient to correct this deficit and may also have antidepressant effects. Rodent studies suggest that n-3 PUFA deficiency during perinatal development can recapitulate key neuropathological, neurochemical, and behavioral features associated with mood disorders. Clinical neuroimaging studies suggest that low n-3 PUFA biostatus is associated with abnormalities in cortical structure and function also observed in mood disorders. Collectively, these findings implicate dietary n-3 PUFA insufficiency, particularly during development, in the pathophysiology of mood dysregulation, and support implementation of routine screening for and treatment of n-3 PUFA deficiency in patients with mood disorders.

185,Medical , Bipolar Disorder  , adolescence; amygdala; prefrontal development        ,"A brain network comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala plays important roles in developmentally regulated cognitive and emotional processes. However, very little is known about the maturation of mPFC-amygdala circuitry. We conducted anatomical tracing of mPFC projections and optogenetic interrogation of their synaptic connections with neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at neonatal to adult developmental stages in mice. Results indicate that mPFC-BLA projections exhibit delayed emergence relative to other mPFC pathways and establish synaptic transmission with BLA excitatory and inhibitory neurons in late infancy, events that coincide with a massive increase in overall synaptic drive. During subsequent adolescence, mPFC-BLA circuits are further modified by excitatory synaptic strengthening as well as a transient surge in feedforward inhibition. The latter was correlated with increased spontaneous inhibitory currents in excitatory neurons, suggesting that mPFC-BLAcircuit maturation culminates in a period of exuberant GABAergic transmission. These findings establish a time course for the onset and refinement of mPFC-BLA transmission and point to potential sensitive periods in the development of this critical network."
1231,Medical , Bipolar Disorder  , interference control; remitted schizophrenia; N450; SP; Stroop        ,"A recent electrophysiological study suggests existing compensatory brain activity as a mechanism for functional recovery of visual attention detection (the capacity for detecting external cues) in symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients. Despite such evidence, little is known about other aspects of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission, such as their capacity to concentrate on the task at hands without being interfered by distracting information. To this end, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 20 symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls while they engaged in a classic Stroop task. Symptomatically remitted patients showed comparable Stroop interference to healthy controls, indicating a degree of functional recovery of such a capacity in these patients. On the neural level, the N450 over the fronto-central and central regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict detection, was found across both groups, although patients presented a reduced N450 relative to healthy controls. By contrast, the amplitude of the sustained potential (SP) (600-800 ms) over the parieto-central and parietal regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict resolution, was significantly increased in patients relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, such increased SP amplitude correlated positively with improved behavioral accuracy in symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia. These findings reveal that symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia increasingly recruited the parietal activity involving successful conflict resolution to offset reduced conflict detection. Therefore, this provides further insight into compensatory mechanisms potentially involving a degree of functional recovery of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission."

This report describes novel molecular and clinical analyses of PER3 VNTR polymorphisms to better define their functional consequences. As the PER3 VNTR is located in the exonic (protein coding) region of PER3, we initially investigated whether both alleles (variants) are transcribed into messenger RNA in human fibroblasts. The VNTR showed bi-allelic gene expression. We next investigated genetic associations in relation to clinical variables in 274 older adult Caucasian individuals. Independent variables included genotypes for the PER3 VNTR as well as a representative set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that tag common variants at the PER3 locus (linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic variants < 0.5). In order to comprehensively evaluate variables analyzed individually in prior analyses, dependent measures included PSG total sleep time and sleep latency, self-rated chronotype, estimated with the Composite Scale (CS), and lifestyle regularity, estimated using the social rhythm metric (SRM). Initially, genetic polymorphisms were individually analyzed in relation to each outcome variable using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Nominally significant associations were further tested using regression analyses that incorporated individual ANOVA-associated DNA variants as potential predictors and each of the selected sleep/circadian variables as outcomes. The covariates included age, gender, body mass index and an index of medical co-morbidity. Significant genetic associations with the VNTR were not detected with the sleep or circadian variables. Nominally significant associations were detected between SNP rs1012477 and CS scores (p = 0.003) and between rs10462021 and SRM (p = 0.047); rs11579477 and average delta power (p = 0.043) (analyses uncorrected for multiple comparisons). In conclusion, alleles of the VNTR are expressed at the transcript level and may have a functional effect in cells expressing the PER3 gene. PER3 polymorphisms had a modest impact on selected sleep/circadian variables in our sample, suggesting that PER3 is associated with sleep and circadian function beyond VNTR polymorphisms. Further replicate analyses in larger, independent samples are recommended."

Since the CCL20-CCR6 axis is an important entry to the brain we differentiated the various T helper cell subpopulations on the basis of their chemokine receptor expression. Methods: FACS staining was performed for Th1,Th2,Th17, Th22 and T regulatory cells on frozen leukocytes of 25 consecutively admitted inpatients affected by a major depressive episode, without psychotic features, in the course of Bipolar Disorder I and 21 healthy controls. The frequency of the T helper populations was associated with DTI and fMRI data acquired on a Philips 3.0 Tesla scanner. Tract based spatial statistic was used to obtain measures of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy, axial, radial and mean diffusivity) from a standard DTI sequence with 35 directions. Patients were also studied for fMRI through a moral valence decision task were subjects had to decide whether morally tuned stimuli were positive or negative. Results: The percentage of circulating Th17 (CCR6(+)CXCR3(neg)CCR4(+)CCR10(neg)) cells correlated positively with higher fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts contributing to the functional integrity of the brain both in patients and healthy controls, while the frequency of circulating T regulatory (CD(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) cells correlated positively with higher radial and mean diffusivity in patients. The frequency of circulating T regulatory cells also correlated to lower neuronal responses to negative versus positive morally tuned stimuli in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of patients. Thl cells correlated negatively with white matter integrity in several tracts (healthy controls), while the cells showed a positive correlation to the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (patients). Conclusion: This study shows a new putative role for Th17 cells. Th17 cells are not only playing a role in inducing autoimmunity and auto-inflammation, but might also play a counter intuitive anabolic role in the maintenance of the functional and structural integrity of the brain.

63,Medical , Birth Control  , Egg production; Fundulus heteroclitus; Mummichog; Fertilization success; Vitellogenin induction        ,"17 alpha-Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a potent estrogen used in birth-control pills. Previous laboratory and field studies have shown negative impacts in a variety of fish species after exposure to low levels of EE2, most notably a nearly complete shutdown of egg production. The present study demonstrates that mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), a small-bodied estuarine species, is able to continue to produce eggs after exposure for 28 d to 100 ng of EE2/L. No effect of EE2 on egg production was observed, whereas a >35-fold increase in vitellogenin (vtg 1) gene expression in males was found. The lack of response in egg production in fish exposed to high levels of EE2 warrants further investigations on species-specific responses to estrogens and endocrine disruptors in general.

66,Medical , Birth Control  , 17Alpha-ethinylestradiol; Largemouth bass; Transcriptomic approach        ,"17Alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), used for birth control in humans, is a potent estrogen that is found in wastewater at low concentrations (ng/l). EE2 has the ability to interfere with the endocrine system of fish, affecting reproduction which can result in population level effects. The objective of this study was to determine if dietary exposure to EE2 would alter gene expression patterns and key pathways in the liver and ovary and whether these could be associated with reproductive endpoints in female large-mouth bass during egg development. Female LMB received 70 ng EE2/g feed (administered at 1% of body weight) for 60 days. EE2 dietary exposure significantly reduced plasma vitellogenin concentrations by 70%. Hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices were also decreased with EE2 feeding by 38.5% and 40%, respectively. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that there were more changes in steady state mRNA levels in the liver compared to the ovary. Genes associated with reproduction were differentially expressed, such as vitellogenin in the liver and aromatase in the gonad. In addition, a set of genes related with oxidative stress (e.g. glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase) were identified as altered in the liver and genes associated with the immune system (e.g. complement component 1, and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin) were altered in the gonad. In a follow-up study with 0.2 ng EE2/g feed for 60 days, similar phenotypic and gene expression changes were observed that support these findings with the higher concentrations. This study provides new insights into how dietary exposure to EE2 interferes with endocrine signaling pathways in female LMB during a critical period of reproductive oogenesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

457,Medical , Birth Control  , Dogs; Gastrointestinal parasites; Zoonosis; Ancylostoma ceylanicum; India        ,"A gastrointestinal parasite survey of 411 stray and refuge dogs sampled from four geographical and climactically distinct locations in India revealed these animals to represent a significant source of environmental contamination for parasites that pose a zoonotic risk to the public. Hookworms were the most commonly identified parasite in dogs in Sikkim (71.3%), Mumbai (48.8%) and Delhi (39.1%). In Ladakh, which experiences harsh extremes in climate, a competitive advantage was observed for parasites such as Sarcocystis spp. (44.2%), Taenia hydatigena (30.3%) and Echinococcus granulosus (2.3%) that utilise intermediate hosts for the completion of their life cycle. PCR identified Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Ancylostoma caninum to occur sympatrically, either as single or mixed infections in Sikkim (Northeast) and Mumbai (West). In Delhi, A. caninum was the only species identified in dogs, probably owing to its ability to evade unfavourable climatic conditions by undergoing arrested development in host tissue. The expansion of the known distribution of A. ceylanicum to the west, as far as Mumbai, justifies the renewed interest in this emerging zoonosis and advocates for its surveillance in future human parasite surveys. Of interest was the absence of Trichuris vulpis in dogs, in support of previous canine surveys in India. This study advocates the continuation of birth control programmes in stray dogs that will undoubtedly have spill-over effects on reducing the levels of environmental contamination with parasite stages. In particular, owners of pet animals exposed to these environments must be extra vigilant in ensuring their animals are regularly dewormed and maintaining strict standards of household and personal hygiene.

With this comes the responsibility to counsel these patients regarding their sexual and reproductive health. This study utilizes representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to compare sexual measures including percentage of that sexually active, age of first sexual activity, number of sexual partners, condom use, and history of sexually transmitted diseases in those with and without congenital heart disease. A total of 1086 patients (1057 without congenital heart disease and 29 with congenital heart disease) were included in this study. Likelihood of being sexually active, age of first sexual intercourse, and condom use did not differ significantly between the two groups after multivariate analysis. Incidence of sexually transmitted disease did not differ between the two groups after multivariate analysis except for genital warts. There are no major differences in sexual measures between those with and without congenital heart disease. The absence of significant differences in sexual measures in those with congenital heart disease compared with the general population places this group of individuals at increased health risk known to occur with pregnancy."

Many developmental phases in infancy and childhood are in strict relationship with an healthy sleep. In the last years some specific recommendations made for how much sleep children need have been published. The empirical evidences for contemporary sleep recommendations has changed and the new recommendations are clearly different from the previous ones and reflect clearly the changes in the sleep need of the children and adolescents in the last decades although seem still to be largely unfitting for preadolescence and adolescence. If sleep is to be treated as a therapeutic intervention, then consensus guidelines, statements, and evidence-based best-practice documents are needed to underpin sleep recommendations for children. Sleep recommendations for children play an important role for public policies and interventions, and to advertise parents and children of the negative consequences of sleep deprivation/reduction."

In this study, we assess whether the importance of dense settlement for infant mortality and child height is moderated by exposure to local sanitation behavior. Is open defecation (i.e., without a toilet or latrine) worse for infant mortality and child height where population density is greater? Is poor sanitation is an important mechanism by which population density influences child health outcomes? We present two complementary analyses using newly assembled data sets, which represent two points in a trade-off between external and internal validity. First, we concentrate on external validity by studying infant mortality and child height in a large, international child-level data set of 172 Demographic and Health Surveys, matched to census population density data for 1,800 subnational regions. Second, we concentrate on internal validity by studying child height in Bangladeshi districts, using a new data set constructed with GIS techniques that allows us to control for fixed effects at a high level of geographic resolution. We find a statistically robust and quantitatively comparable interaction between sanitation and population density with both approaches: open defecation externalities are more important for child health outcomes where people live more closely together."

But without directed pressure, comparative data and tools to provide insight into successes, failures, and overall results, accountability fails. The analysis of accountability mechanisms in five countries supported by the Evidence for Action program shows that accountability is most effective when it is connected across global and national levels; civil society has a central and independent role; proactive, immediate and targeted implementation mechanisms are funded from the start; advocacy for accountability is combined with local outreach activities such as blood drives; local and national champions (Presidents, First Ladies, Ministers) help draw public attention to government performance; scorecards are developed to provide insight into performance and highlight necessary improvements; and politicians at subnational level are supported by national leaders to effect change. Under the Sustainable Development Goals, accountability and advocacy supported by global and regional intergovernmental organizations, constantly monitored and with commensurate retribution for nonperformance will remain essential.

This study examines the relationship between health conditions, specialist health service utilisation and academic performance in Australian children. Methods: This was a quasi-longitudinal study where School Entrant Health Questionnaire (a survey tool with parent report on children's health) data for 24 678 children entering school in 2008 was matched with the 2011 National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN). Linear and logistic regressions were used to examine associations between health conditions, use of a specialist health service and reading and numeracy scores. Results: The study comprised 24 678 children. Children with allergies, very low birth weight, developmental delay, diabetes, spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, birth abnormality, speech problems, intellectual disability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had lower numeracy scores than those without any of these conditions (P < 0.05). The same children had higher odds (1.2-5.8) of being at or below the national minimum standard for numeracy. Children with developmental delay, epilepsy, dental problems, speech, intellectual disabilities and low birth weight had lower reading scores than those without these conditions (P < 0.05) and had higher odds of being at (odds ratio: 1.3) or below (odds ratio: 3.7) the national minimum standard for reading. Children with health conditions who had ever accessed specialist health services did not differ in their academic performance from those that had not used specialist health services. Conclusions: Some health conditions put children at risk of poorer academic performance, and interventions to prevent this such as appropriate support services in schools should be considered."

A 10 mM ammonium acetate adjusted at pH 9 by 3% ammonium hydroxide and including a 5% methanol addition was used as an optimum background electrolyte (BGE). The optimum BGE provided both the baseline electrophoretic separation of the drugs and highly compatible connection of CE to the electro-spray ionization (ESI) interface. The optimized working conditions were favorable for the selective and sensitive QqQ MS detection of the separated compounds according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The proposed method was validated in terms of precision (RSDs for the repeatability of migration times and peak areas of the analyzed drugs were less than 1.66 and 6.06%, respectively), linearity (determination coefficient ranged in the interval of 0.9987-0.9995), limits of quantitation (sub A mu g mL(-1) levels), and accuracy (mean recoveries of all the analytes in pharmaceutical matrix ranged in the interval of 98.23-101.2%). The CE-ESI-QqQ MS method is fast, simple, selective, precise, and accurate, and was successfully applied to a highly reliable determination of the targeted drugs (for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) in commercial pharmaceuticals (tablet dosage forms)."

Host pathological inflammatory responses termed type 1 reaction (T1R) are a leading cause of nerve damage for leprosy patients. The environmental or inherited factors that predispose leprosy cases to undergo T1R are not known. However, studies have shown an important contribution of host genetics for susceptibility to T1R. We have previously identified variants encompassing the TNFSF15/TNFSF8 genes as T1R risk factors in a Vietnamese sample and replicated this association in a Brazilian sample. However, we failed to validate in Brazilian patients the strong association of TNFSF15/TNFSF8 markers rs6478108 and rs7863183 with T1R that we had observed in Vietnamese patients. Here, we investigated if the lack of validation of these variants was due to age-dependent effects on association using four independent population samples, two from Brazil and two from Vietnam. In the combined analysis across the four samples, we observed a strong association of the TNFSF15/TNFSF8 variants rs6478108, rs7863183, and rs3181348 with T1R (p(combined) = 1.5E-05, p(combined) = 1.8E-05, and p(combined) = 6.5E-06, respectively). However, the association of rs6478108 with T1R was more pronounced in leprosy cases under 30 years of age compared to the global sample [odds ratio (OR) = 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.54-2.46, p(combined) = 2.5E-08 versus OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.23-1.73, p(combined) = 1.5E-05]. A multivariable analysis indicated that the association of rs6478108 with T1R was independent of either rs7863183 or rs3181348. These three variants are known regulators of the TNFSF8 gene transcription level in multiple tissues. The age dependency of association of rs6478108 and T1R suggests that the genetic control of gene expression varies across the human life span."

It typically follows a chronic course and patients undergo longterm medical and surgical therapy. We set out to describe current surgical practice in the management of pCD in the UK. Method A survey of surgical management of pCD was designed by an expert group of colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists. This assessed acute, elective, multidisciplinary and definitive surgical management. A pilot of the questionnaire was undertaken at the 2015 meeting of the Digestive Disease Federation. The survey was refined and distributed nationally through the trainee collaborative networks. Results National rollout obtained responses from 133 of 179 surgeons approached (response rate 74.3%). At first operation, 32% of surgeons would always consider drainage of sepsis and 31.1% would place a draining seton. At first elective operation, 66.6% would routinely insert of draining seton, and 84.4% would avoid cutting seton. An IBD multidisciplinary team was available to 87.6% of respondents, although only 25.1% routinely discussed pCD patients. Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha therapy was routinely considered by 64.2%, although 44.2% left medical management to gastroenterologists. Common definitive procedures were removal of the seton only (70.7%), fistulotomy (57.1%), advancement flap (38.9%), fistula plug (36.4%) and ligation of intersphincteric track (LIFT) procedure (31.8%). Indications for diverting stoma or proctectomy were intractable sepsis, incontinence and poor quality of life. Conclusion This survey has demonstrated areas of common practice, but has also highlighted divergent practice including choices of definitive surgery and multimodal management. Practical guidelines are required to support colorectal surgeons in the UK."

A large-scale retrospective cohort study was conducted comparing the clinical features and outcome of CD-associated SBA and de novo SBA. Method Data for patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma were gathered from the 1992-2010 United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registry- Medicare linked database. We identified 2123 patients, of whom 179 had CD-associated and 1944 de novo SBA. The main outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Results CD-associated SBA was most commonly located in the ileum (62% vs 31%, P < 0.0001). CD patients were diagnosed at an earlier stage (I/II), compared with de novo SBA (55% vs 32%, P < 0.0001), and were more likely to undergo surgery (81% vs 72%, P = 0.0016). Chemotherapy use was similar (25% vs 21%, P = 0.1886). Patients with CD-associated SBA had better 5-year OS (43% vs 34%, P = 0.0121) but a similar CSS (65% vs 64%, P = 0.77). There was no difference in the OS between the cohorts when stratified by stage. On multivariate analysis, CD was not significantly related to OS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.20, P = 0.7889]. Surgery and the extent of lymphadenectomy improved OS for all SBA patients (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88, P = 0.001), whereas chemotherapy did not (HR 1.13, 95% CI: 0.99-1.28, P = 0.0665). Conclusion Patients with CD-associated SBA present at an earlier stage than patients with de novo SBA, they receive more surgery but similar rates of chemotherapy, and have similar OS and CSS. The presence of CD does not worsen survival after treatment of SBA."

A recent survey of surgical practice in this condition showed variation in management approaches. As a result we set out to devise recommendations for practice for UK colorectal surgeons. Method Results from a national survey were used to devise a set of potential consensus statements. Consultant colorectal surgeons were invited to participate in the exercise via the previous survey and the mailing list of the professional society. Iterative voting was performed on each statement using a five-point Likert scale and electronic voting, with opportunity for discussion and refinement between each vote. Consensus was defined as >80% agreement. Results Seventeen surgeons and two patient representatives voted upon 51 statements. Consensus was achieved on 39 items. Participants advocated a patientcentred approach by a colorectal specialist, within strong multidisciplinary teamworking. The use of anti-TNF alpha therapy is advocated. Where definitive surgical techniques are considered they should be carefully selected to avoid adverse impact on function. Ano/rectovaginal fistulas should be managed by specialists in fistulating disease. Stoma or proctectomy could be discussed earlier in a patient's treatment pathway to improve choice, as they may improve quality of life. Conclusion This consensus provides principles and guidance for best practice in managing patients with fpCD."

Cognitive decline was determined by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde-MDA and superoxide dismutase-SOD) were determined and DNA damage was assayed using Alkaline Comet Assay. Toenail samples were taken and analyzed using ICP-MS to determine trace element levels. A total of 62.1 % of subjects had cognitive impairment. Subjects with cognitive impairment had significantly higher levels of MDA and DNA damage as compared to the group with normal cognitive function; MDA (2.07 +/- 0.05 nmol/L vs 1.85 +/- 0.06 nmol/L) (p < 0.05) and DNA damage (% Tail Density, 14.52 +/- 0.32 vs 10.31 +/- 0.42; Tail Moment, 1.79 +/- 0.06 vs 1.28 +/- 0.06) (p < 0.05 for all parameters). However, the level of SOD among subjects with cognitive impairment (6.67 +/- 0.33 u.e/min/mg protein) was lower than the level among those with normal cognitive functions (11.36 +/- 0.65 u.e/min/mg protein) (p < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression revealed the predictors for cognitive impairment among the subjects were DNA damage (Adjusted odd ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-1.59), level of trace elements in toenails namely, lead (OR, 2.471; CI, 1.535-3.980) and copper (OR, 1.275; CI, 1.047-1.552) (p < 0.05). High levels of lead and copper can lead to increase in oxidative stress levels and are associated with DNA damage that eventually could be associated with cognitive decline."
1463,Medical , Dementia  , Osteoporosis; Major fracture; Secondary prevention; Obstacles to treatment        ,"A Summary The majority of patients do not receive anti-osteoporotic treatment following a major osteoporotic fracture, despite the guidelines and the availability of effective anti-osteoporotic treatments. The fight against factors limiting the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis should become a priority to improve secondary prevention after an initial osteoporotic fracture. Purpose Despite the availability of effective anti-osteoporotic treatments, osteoporosis management is currently insufficient. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of anti-osteoporotic treatments introduced after an initial prior major osteoporotic fracture during hospitalization for recurring fractures. Methods We conducted an observational, cross-sectional, bicentric study that included all patients aged over 50 years who were hospitalized or seen in consultation for major osteoporotic fracture. Results One hundred twenty-eight out of two hundred four (62.7%) patients had a past history of major osteoporotic fracture and therefore had an indication of treatment based on guidelines. Among these patients, only 43/128 (33.5%) had received anti-osteoporotic treatment as secondary prevention after the initial fracture. The main causes of non-prescription identified were the attending physicians' ignorance of the indication of treatment (n = 30; 35.3%), ignorance of the fracture (n = 17; 20%), and comorbidities (n = 12; 14.1%). The failure to introduce treatment was associated with the presence of comorbidities with a Charlson Comorbidity Index = 6 (OR = 0.34 [0.16-0.73], p < 0.05), dementia (OR = 0.23 [0.08-0.72], p < 0.05), and past history of proximal femur fracture (OR = 0.20 [0.04-0.91], p < 0.05). Conclusions Two thirds of patients with a past history of major osteoporotic fracture presenting with a new fracture were not treated. The main reason for lack of treatment seems to stem from the incorrect assessment of the patient's fracture risk. Although major osteoporotic fracture leads to an increased risk of mortality and requires treatment, the significance of patient comorbidities was an independent risk factor leading to non-treatment."
1657,Medical , Dementia  , Alzheimer's disease; ALS/FTD; Hippocampal sclerosis; TDP-43 proteinopathy; Cryptic exon; Neurodegeneration        ,"Abnormal accumulation of TDP-43 into cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions with accompanying nuclear clearance, a common pathology initially identified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), has also been found in Alzheimer' disease (AD). TDP-43 serves as a splicing repressor of non-conserved cryptic exons and that such function is compromised in brains of ALS and FTD patients, suggesting that nuclear clearance of TDP-43 underlies its inability to repress cryptic exons. However, whether TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregates are a prerequisite for the incorporation of cryptic exons is not known. Here, we assessed hippocampal tissues from 34 human postmortem brains including cases with confirmed diagnosis of AD neuropathologic changes along with age-matched controls. We found that cryptic exon incorporation occurred in all AD cases exhibiting TDP-43 pathology. Furthermore, incorporation of cryptic exons was observed in the hippocampus when TDP-43 inclusions was restricted only to the amygdala, the earliest stage of TDP-43 progression. Importantly, cryptic exon incorporation could be detected in AD brains lacking TDP-43 inclusion but exhibiting nuclear clearance of TDP-43. These data supports the notion that the functional consequence of nuclear depletion of TDP-43 as determined by cryptic exon incorporation likely occurs as an early event of TDP-43 proteinopathy and may have greater contribution to the pathogenesis of AD than currently appreciated. Early detection and effective repression of cryptic exons in AD patients may offer important diagnostic and therapeutic implications for this devastating illness of the elderly."

Guided by the life-course perspective, we analyzed qualitative interview data from members of 27 African American families including the person with MCI (PwMCI), a relative or friend who was highly involved in the PwMCI's daily life, and if available, a relative or friend who had at least monthly contact with the PwMCI. Findings uncovered variability in families' MCI awareness, assessment, and need for role changes; the importance of reaching out to trusted others; and honoring PwMCI's care preferences (e.g., who should provide care). Families held varying beliefs about engaging outside support; some families insisted on keeping all care within the family while others were open to the use of external services. We showcase how diagnosis acceptance and family decision-making are at the heart of how African American families respond to MCI."
2154,Medical , Dementia  , Dementia; Cerebral disease; Vascular disease; Vascular risk factors; Autonomic dysfunction; Atherosclerosis; Neurovascular coupling        ,"Ageing is the primary risk factor for cognitive deterioration. Given that the cerebral blood flow (CBF) or regulation of cerebral circulation is attenuated in the elderly, it could be expected that ageing-induced cognitive deterioration may be affected by a decrease in CBF as a result of brain ischemia and energy depletion. CBF regulation associated with cerebral metabolism thus likely plays an important role in the preservation of cognitive function. However, in some specific conditions (e.g. during exercise), change in CBF does not synchronize with that of cerebral metabolism. Our recent study demonstrated that cognitive function was more strongly affected by changes in cerebral metabolism than by changes in CBF during exercise. Therefore, it remains unclear how an alteration in CBF or its regulation affects cognitive function. In this review, I summarize current knowledge on previous investigations providing the possibility of an interaction between regulation of CBF or cerebral metabolism and cognitive function."

The prevalence of diabetes and the other metabolic disorders has noticeably increased worldwide. A causal link between increasing risk of type 2 diabetes and exposure to environmental pollutants has been reported. 2. We hypothesized that exposure to methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate additive to gasoline would hinder zinc and glucose homeostasis in rats. 3. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received MTBE in drinking water for 90 days. At the end of the treatment, pancreas and blood samples were collected for biochemical and molecular examinations. Expression of four candidate genes, including Insulin1, Insulin2, MT1A, SLC30A8 by Real-Time Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) as well as biochemical parameters, including fasting blood glucose (FBS), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHO), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), copper (Cu2+) and calcium (Ca2+) levels as well as High-sensitive C-reactive protein were assessed as endpoints. 4.

The insulin detection ability of each biosensor was determined using interferometric reflectance spectroscopy, using a range of different media both with and without serum. Sensing performance was compared in terms of response value, response time and limit of detection (LOD) for each platform. In order to demonstrate the capability of the best performing biosensor to detect insulin from real samples, an in vitro investigation with the aptamer-modified surface was performed. This biosensor was exposed to buffer conditioned by glucose-stimulated human islets, with the result showing a positive response and a high degree of selectivity towards insulin capture. The obtained results correlated well with the ELISA used in the clinic for assaying glucose-stimulated insulin release from donor islets. We anticipate that this type of sensor can be applied as a rapid point-of-use biosensor to assess the quality of donor islets in terms of their insulin production efficiency, prior to transplantation."

Here, we described clinical features that should alert the physicians on the possibility of melioidosis. In this review of 86 cases from 2001 to 2011, the common presentations of melioidosis in the Emergency Department (ED), Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia were; male gender (79.1 %), in working age group (47.8 +/- 15.2 year-old), worked in contact with soil (73.3 %), presented with fever (91.9 %), in rainy season (55.8 %), have underlying diabetes mellitus (79.1 %), have leukocytosis (67.4 %) and high blood glucose (62.8 %) during presentation. In 34.9 % of cases, the antimicrobials were initiated at the ED and only 10.5 % include antimelioid drugs. Thirty-one patients (36.0 %) died due to melioidosis and 51.6 % of this were within 48 h of admission. Despite high mortality rate, the clinical awareness on the possibility of melioidosis among emergency physicians is still low and need to be strengthened."

This gap results, in part, from a lack of integration between epidemiologic science and social psychology theory, particularly regarding the intersections of stress, self-regulatory health behaviors, and the biological mechanisms underlying the development of diabetes. In this commentary, we describe the utility of a theoretical framework that focuses on the intersection of biological, psychosocial, and environmental contexts as they apply to diabetes disparities, and how such a framework could inform a translational research agenda to reorient prevention efforts to address these inequalities. Such reorientation is needed to ensure that the implementation of prevention efforts does not inadvertently widen diabetes disparities."

Attempts to identify cellular activators of PPAR delta produced large lists of various fatty acids and their metabolic derivatives; however, there is no consensus on specific and selective binding interactions of natural ligands with PPAR delta. Most models on binding interactions within the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPAR delta have been derived from analyses of PPAR delta-LBD crystals formed with synthetic low molecular weight ligands. Nonetheless, crystals of the whole receptor with natural ligands or of its heterodimer with its cognate retinoid X receptor (RXR) are not yet available for analysis. We have found that 4-hydroxyalkenals, non-enzymatic peroxidation products of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), namely, 4-hydroxy-2E,6Z-dodecadienal (4-HDDE) and 4-hydroxy-2E-nonenal (4-HNE), activate PPAR delta in vascular endothelial cells and insulin-secreting beta cells, respectively. In both cases activated PPAR delta induced adaptive responses that allowed the cells to adjust to ambient stressful metabolic conditions. This review article addresses the interactions of 4-hydroxyalkenals with PPAR delta and the resulting hormetic interactions in cells exposed to nutrient overload conditions.

Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators."
104,Medical , Weight Loss  , Molten salt corrosion; 9Cr-1Mo steel; Plasma spray coating; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Corrosion behavior        ,"9Cr-1Mo steel has been proposed as the container material for the electrorefining process of pyrochemical reprocessing of spent metallic fuels from the future sodium cooled fast breeder reactors. The electrorefining process was carried out using LiCl-KCl-UCl3 molten salt as the electrolyte at 500 A degrees C under argon atmosphere. To protect the electrorefining vessel, made of 9Cr-1Mo steel from the attack by the electrolyte, yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) ceramic coating was deposited on 9Cr-1Mo steel by thermal spray process. The corrosion behavior of 9Cr-1Mo steel with and without YSZ coating was evaluated in LiCl-KCl-UCl3 molten salt at 600 A degrees C under argon atmosphere for various durations (100, 250, 500 and 1000 h). The results revealed that with increase in exposure time, the weight loss of uncoated 9Cr-1Mo steel samples increased, while YSZ coated 9Cr-1Mo steel samples exhibited insignificant weight loss. SEM examination of exposed uncoated 9Cr-1Mo steel samples showed Cr depletion on the surface and formation of chromium based oxides as corrosion products. After the corrosion experiment, SEM/EDS and XRD analyses of both coated and uncoated samples showed the presence of Fe-Cr and UO2."

Applications of the nanorods in environmental pollution removal, photothermal conversion and light-induced water evaporation were investigated. The influence of the reaction time, morphology, and crystal phase on the photocatalysis, photothermal conversion and light-induced water evaporation was discussed. The results showed maximum removal value of rhodamine B by 97.8% at 1 h timepoint. Aqueous dispersion of the core-shell CdS-Cu7S4 heterostructures nanorods prepared with 2 h (1.0 g/L) exhibited a good photothermal conversion performance as it saw increase in sample temperature by 37.8 C-circle in 300 s under the irradiation of 980 nm laser. The exposure of as-obtained sample film to simulated sunlight irradiation at 2 h (8 mg) increased the weight loss of pure water by 0.62 g in 30 min with the water evaporation efficiency up to 48.4%. We are reporting an excellent light-induced water evaporation performance potential of the nanorods discussed."
405,Medical , Digestive Health  , carcass and meat quality; digestive health; growth; intake management; young rabbit        ,"A field enquiry mentioned the potential positive impact of a feed restriction on the health of young rabbits, but no objective information relates the intake to digestive health. The effects of a post-weaning feed restriction strategy were thus studied on digestive health and growth and carcass parameters of the growing rabbit, using a monofactorial design that produces a quantitative linear reduction of the intake, from ad libitum (AL group) to 80%, 70% and 60% of AL. The study was performed simultaneously in six experimental sites, on 1984 growing rabbits (496 per treatment) collectively caged from weaning (34 to 38 days of age, depending on the site) to slaughter (68 to 72 days). The feeding programme was applied as followed: restriction during 21 days after weaning, and then ad libitum till slaughter During the feed restriction period the growth rate was linearly reduced with the restriction level, by 0.5 g/day for each percent of intake reduction. When returning to ad libitum intake (after 54 days old) a compensatory growth and a higher feed efficiency occurred. Therefore, the impact of the feeding programme on the slaughter weight (SW) was significant (-4.5 g/% of restriction), but relatively moderate: the weight loss of the more-restricted rabbits (60%) reached 7.7% (-200 g) compared to the AL group. Over the whole fattening period the feed restriction reduced linearly and significantly the feed conversion (FC) (-0.0077 unit/% of restriction). Carcass traits were little affected by the feeding programme, except for a slightly lower decrease of the dressing percentage (mean: 1.2 units between AL and the three restricted groups). On the six experimental sites, mortality and morbidity were always caused by acute digestive disorders, namely diarrhoea and/or caecal impaction. Independent of the treatment, the mortality rate strongly varied according to the site (between 7% and 18% from weaning to 54 days and for the AL group). During feed restriction, the mortality was significantly lower from a restriction threshold of 80% (meanly: -9% compared to AL). The morbidity was also significantly reduced (-6%) for the two most restricted groups (70% and 60%). The favourable effect of a lower intake on health did not persist after returning to ad libitum intake (54 days to slaughter), since mortality and morbidity were not significantly different among the treatments. Such a feeding strategy thus represents a double benefit in terms of feed costs and lower losses of young rabbits."
464,Medical , Digestive Health  , intestinal flora; Lactobacillus; Bifidobacterium; sub-optimal health; probiotics        ,"A general idea of probiotics is given with some links to the dietary fibre. Human beings must be associated with microorganisms. The skin has hundreds grams of bacteria although, more surprisingly, the gastric tract is calculated to have I kg of microorganisms, the so-called intestinal flora. In other words, it is up to 10(11-12)/g of faeces. The most dominant genera (10(9-11)/g faeces) belonging to class I are anaerobic bacteria including Bifidobacteria. Group II includes facultative bacteria and their numbers are relatively low (10(5-8)/g faeces). The fewest bacteria such as pathogenic Clostridium perfringens and E. coli belong to class III (Mitsuoka., 1975). The small intestine possesses relatively low numbers of bacteria. However, this organ is very important because of a particular immune trap for bacteria, Peyer's patch scattering over the area. The large intestine is the largest house for the microbes. Aging is known to invite a significant reduction in Bifidobacteria, the most beneficial bacteria. Diet influences the intestinal flora balance as well. Probiotic bacteria should belong to group W. They are usually transient bacteria and proven to give beneficial effects on both digestive and immune systems. For example, Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult improved the growth of preterm infants (Kitajima et al., 1997). Lactobacillus casei Shirota was reported to improve the constipation (Koebnick et al., 2001), and to increase natural killer cell activity. In this streamline, a habitual intake of this probiotic strain was reported to reduce the risk of bladder cancer (Aso et al., 1995, Ohashi et al., 2002). In addition there are many reports of other probiotic strains improving digestive health (Duggan et al., 2002)."
1255,Medical , Digestive Health  , gastroesophageal reflux disease; disease management; heartburn; case-finding        ,"A reliable, accurate noninvasive method for identifying patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in the primary care setting is needed. A population-based case-finding instrument may assist managed care organizations in identifying candidates for disease management or quality improvement programs. Our aim was to develop and validate a GERD case-finding instrument. A 12-item ""GERD Screener"" was developed based on literature review and expert opinion with questions about heartburn and regurgitation frequency and severity and medication use, as well demographics and exclusion criteria. Categorical and continuous scoring methods with and without medication use were developed a priori. Using a telephone interview in a medical group, we identified and enrolled 100 subjects with a history of GERD-like symptoms and 103 controls. Each subject completed the GERD Screener, a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire, the Digestive Health Symptom Index (DHSI), and was evaluated independently by two gastroenterologists using a structured format. Agreement by the two physicians that symptoms were consistent with GERD and required an intervention was considered the gold standard. In all, 70 subjects were classified as having GERD and 106 as controls using the gold standard (kappa = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.82). The scoring method for the screening instrument using a continuous measure of GERD symptoms (frequency and severity) and weighted medication use resulted in an area under ROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94). Using a cutoff of >9 points, this measure was 83% sensitive and 83% specific. Compared to the gold standard, the DHSI GERD subscale has an area under ROC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94). The GERD Screener was highly correlated with the DHSI GERD subscale, r = 0.78 (95% CI 0.72-0.83; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, the GERD Screener has demonstrated construct, convergent, and predictive validity. It is shorter than existing validated instruments, practical, and easily administered, which may reduce the response and administrative burden. This may serve as a valuable case-finding instrument in primary-care and managed-care organizations wishing to implement programs to improve the quality and efficiency of care."

The most recent recommendations have implicated several classes of fibre, including low-digested fibre (lignocellulose) and digestible fibre (hemicelluloses and pectins). Moreover, agro-industrial by-products (brans and pulps), rich in digestible fibre, are often incorporated in rabbit feeding, although this fibre fraction is not analysed by the current routine method. Therefore, the present review focuses on the respective role of low-digested and digestible fibre fractions in the digestive health of the growing rabbit, after weaning. It gives levels of fibre classes, including pectins, in some feed ingredients classically used in rabbit feeding. A brief overview of some characteristics of dietary fibre and some routine methods to estimate fibre fractions in animal feed ingredients are presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Our study presents observations on the treatment of postoperative DU on a group of elderly patients (>60 years) with associated chronic diseases. The studied group includes patients hospitalized between 2005 - 2010 in the Department of Surgery, in Sf. Pantelimon, Sf. loan, and Coltea Hospitals.

This analysis explores the reproductive trajectories of Mexican women with HIV post-diagnosis and their access to reproductive counselling and use of contraceptives. In-depth interviews and short surveys were conducted with women of reproductive age living with HIV. Results indicate that sexual and reproductive health counselling in HIV care focuses on the male condom and does not routinely address reproductive desires or provide information about or access to other contraceptive methods. Unintended pregnancies result from inconsistent condom use and condom breakage. Women experienced discriminatory denial of and pressure to accept particular contraceptive methods because of their HIV status. Mexican women with HIV are not enjoying their constitutionally guaranteed right to freely choose the number and spacing of their children. Mexico's commitment to reproductive rights and the Popular Health Insurance offer policy and financial frameworks for providing family planning services in public HIV clinics. To ensure respectful implementation, rights-based training for HIV healthcare providers and careful monitoring and evaluation will be needed."

The study sought to establish awareness, utilisation, and attitude towards the use of emergency contraception (EC) among patients seen at the Commercial City Reproductive Health Clinic in Durban, South Africa. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted by means of a self-administered questionnaire among 103 sexually active females between the ages of 18-49 years. More than two-thirds (72.8%) of the participants heard about EC and among them 85.3% had used EC. Among those who heard about EC, 53.3% of them heard about are from clinics. About two-thirds (63.1%) participants knew the correct timing when EC should be taken following sexual intercourse, and majority (73.7%) indicated that EC is used to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Majority (77.6%) of the participants displayed a positive attitude towards the use of EC. About a third (31.1%) of the participants reported that EC was against their cultural beliefs or religions. Majority (82.5%) also indicated to recommend EC to other women as a family planning method. Awareness of utilisation of EC was good among the participants. Most of the women displayed positive attitudes towards EC and perceived it to be beneficial.

641,Medical , Emergency Contraception  , Abortion; Contraception; Nepal        ,"A longstanding debate exists in population policy about the relationship between modern contraception and abortion. Although theory predicts that they should be substitutes, the empirical evidence is difficult to interpret. What is required is a large-scale intervention that alters the supply (or full price) of one or the other and, importantly, that does so in isolation (reproductive health programs often bundle primary health care and family planning-and in some instances, abortion services). In this article, we study Nepal's 2004 legalization of abortion provision and subsequent expansion of abortion services, an unusual and rapidly implemented policy meeting these requirements. Using four waves of rich individual-level data representative of fertile-age Nepalese women, we find robust evidence of substitution between modern contraception and abortion. This finding has important implications for public policy and foreign aid, suggesting that an effective strategy for reducing expensive and potentially unsafe abortions may be to expand the supply of modern contraceptives."

Clinician prescribing practices varied, which may have resulted in contraceptive needs (for some students) not being met in a timely manner. Clinicians had different understandings of policies about prescribing contraceptives when on-call, when students called in, and for students who had graduated. Education and policies about handling EC and contraception requests are necessary so that clinicians meet students' reproductive health needs."

640,Medical , Mental Health  , Hearing loss; Sign language; Language deprivation; Deaf child development; Cochlear implant        ,"A long-standing belief is that sign language interferes with spoken language development in deaf children, despite a chronic lack of evidence supporting this belief. This deserves discussion as poor life outcomes continue to be seen in the deaf population. This commentary synthesizes research outcomes with signing and non-signing children and highlights fully accessible language as a protective factor for healthy development. Brain changes associated with language deprivation may be misrepresented as sign language interfering with spoken language outcomes of cochlear implants. This may lead to professionals and organizations advocating for preventing sign language exposure before implantation and spreading misinformation. The existence of one-time-sensitive-language acquisition window means a strong possibility of permanent brain changes when spoken language is not fully accessible to the deaf child and sign language exposure is delayed, as is often standard practice. There is no empirical evidence for the harm of sign language exposure but there is some evidence for its benefits, and there is growing evidence that lack of language access has negative implications. This includes cognitive delays, mental health difficulties, lower quality of life, higher trauma, and limited health literacy. Claims of cochlear implant- and spoken language-only approaches being more effective than sign language-inclusive approaches are not empirically supported. Cochlear implants are an unreliable standalone first-language intervention for deaf children. Priorities of deaf child development should focus on healthy growth of all developmental domains through a fully-accessible first language foundation such as sign language, rather than auditory deprivation and speech skills."

Here, the parameter of interest is the difference in causal treatment effects between the subpopulations that take part in different numbers of therapy sessions. For this data set, interactions between random treatment allocation and prognostic baseline variables provide the requisite instrumental variables. While the corresponding two-stage least squares (TSLS) estimator tends to have smaller bias than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator; the TSLS suffers from larger variance. It is therefore appealing to combine the desirable properties of the OLS and TSLS estimators. Such a trade-off is achieved through an affine combination of these two estimators, using mean squared error as a criterion. This produces the semi-parametric Stein-like (SPSL) estimator as introduced by Judge and Mittelhammer (2004). The SPSL estimator is used in conjunction with multiple imputation with chained equations, to provide an estimator that can exploit all available information. Simulated data are also generated to illustrate the superiority of the SPSL estimator over its OLS and TSLS counterparts. A package entitled SteinIV implementing these methods has been made available through the R platform. (C) 2017 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Parental assessment measures included the modified STAI-C. The results underlined the program's feasibility and acceptability. Clinical effects of the mindfulness-based program were observed. Self-assessed data for children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group showed increased mindfulness and decreased depression. Reduced anxiety was found in all groups. Positive affect tended to improve from pre-test to post-test in children who had practiced mindfulness compared to the WLC group. Parental assessments showed significant improvement in positive affect and decreases in anxiety and negative affect in the intervention group compared to the WLC group. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies were also affected by the mindfulness-based program. Rumination scores significantly decreased from pre-test to post-test in the intervention group. This preliminary study suggests that regular mindfulness practice presents a promising approach to reducing the burden of this neonatal malformation."

The attraction of natural enemies towards herbivore-induced plant volatiles is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the majority of published studies are carried under optimal water and nutrient regimes and with just one herbivore. But what happens when additional levels of ecological complexity are added? Does the presence of a second herbivore, microorganisms, and abiotic stress interfere with plant-natural enemy communication? or is communication stable enough to withstand disruption by additional biotic and abiotic factors? 2. Investigating the effects of these additional levels of ecological complexity is key to understanding the stability of tritrophic interactions in natural ecosystems and may aid to forecast the impact of environmental disturbances on these, especially in climate change scenarios, which are often associated with modifications in plant and arthropod species distribution and increased levels of abiotic stress. 3. This review explores the literature on natural enemy attraction to herbivore-induced volatiles when, besides herbivory, plants are challenged by additional biotic and abiotic factors. 4. The aim of this review was to establish the impact of different biotic and abiotic factors on plant-natural enemy communication and to highlight critical aspects to guide future research efforts."

The role of dietary pyridoxine in modulating immunity and prevention of fungal infection was assessed by haemato-immunological parameters like erythrocyte counts (EC), leucocyte counts (LC), haemoglobulin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT), phagocytic activity, albumin, globulin, total plasma protein, albumin/globulin and by challenge study with Saprolegnia parasitica, where relative percentage survival (RPS) were recorded. Hb, PCV, MCV, MCH, NBT, total plasma protein, albumin, globulin contents, lysozyme and phagocytic activity was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in DP fed group. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher RPS was recorded from T2 group fed with 0.02% DP for 45 days. Hence, DP has the capacity to stimulate nonspecific immunity and increase resistance to S. parasitica infection in L. rohita fingerlings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

On examination, he had moderate hepatosplenomegaly with multiple enlarged cervical and axillary lymph nodes. His hemogram revealed anemia and marked eosinophilia. Initial investigations were negative, except anti-HCV IgG antibodies, that were positive. Bone marrow aspirate showed a single histiocyte containing suspicious intracellular yeast-like forms. Cervical lymph node aspiration revealed a heavy load of intra-and extracellular Histoplasma spp. Disseminated histoplasmosis remains an unusual cause of peripheral eosinophilia and diagnosis can often be rendered fairly easily by cytomorphological evaluation. The case illustrates how Indian pathologists must maintain a high index of suspicion for unexpected infectious disorders in cases with eosinophilia."
296,Medical , Fungal Infection  , Chitin; Chitinase; Chitin Synthase; Chitin Lectins; Hyaluronan; Hyaluronidase; Hyaluronan Synthase; Alzheimer's Disease; Gaucher's Disease        ,"A controversy arose decades ago whether the DG42 gene product expressed during frog embryogenesis synthesized hyaluronan or chitin. Both sets of investigators were correct. It is now possible to understand how prescient those findings were. Synthesis of a seven to nine chitin sugar chain fragment is required before hyaluronan synthesis begins. Thus, DG42 indeed synthesizes both hyaluronan and chitin. Hyaluronan turns over rapidly in vertebrate tissues, but chitin oligomers are difficult to degrade. They accumulate and can cause pathology. Chitin is a simple beta-linked repeating sugar homopolymer found prominently in the building block structures of fungi, molluscs, arthropods, and other forms of invertebrate life. It is a highly resistant insoluble material requiring chitin synthases for production and chitinases for degradation. Mysteriously, chitins and chitinases also occur in vertebrate tissues, while it had previously been assumed that no chitins were contained therein. That assumption is now challenged based on recent biochemical evidence. Chitin does accumulate in many tissues, but may be particularly toxic to neurons. Its accumulation in the brain may account for the cognitive decline found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The DG42 observations together with the participation of chitins and chitinases in several human diseases, among which in addition to Alzheimer's disease include Gaucher's disease, asthma, and aspects of abnormal immune recognition justify a reexamination of these topics. The purpose of this review is to summarize data in order to place chitins and their attendant enzymes in a rational framework in an attempt to create a cohesive story."

Although initial investigations were equivocal for an infectious etiology, subsequent investigations led to a diagnosis of tuberculosis as the cause for right-sided cavernous sinus syndrome.

The diagnosis of butterfly glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) was made based on imaging characteristics and was further confirmed by biopsy findings. As the corpus callosum is usually resistant to infiltration by tumours, a mass that involves and crosses the corpus callosum is suggestive of an aggressive neoplasm. Other neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions that may involve the corpus callosum and mimic a butterfly glioma, as well as associated imaging features, are discussed."

Threemyelogramswere negative for leak, and nontargeted epidural blood patches did not result in symptom relief. A cerebrospinal fluid leak study using 111In-DTPA with SPECT/CT demonstrated a focal area of asymmetric activity at the left C2 nerve root. A left C2 root tie-off, targeted epidural blood patch, and Dura seal glue resulted in resolution of patient symptomatology highlighting the importance of fused SPECT/CT images in detection of an occult cerebral spinal fluid leak."

She had an uneventful medical history; however, the physical examination upon hospital admission revealed a hypertensive emergency, papilledema, and 2+ dipstick proteinuria. Upon establishing the diagnosis of preeclampsia, aggressive therapy with corticosteroids, antihypertensive medication, and seizure prophylaxis was initiated. Hemodynamic stability was achieved within 24 hours and the patient remained in the observation unit located within the gynecology clinic. On the ninth day postadmission, however, her condition abruptly deteriorated and advanced to imminent eclampsia, accompanied by transient vision loss, altered mental status, and acute hypertensive crisis. After the patient underwent successful emergent delivery via caesarean section, a laboratory workup revealed hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count, suggesting HELLP syndrome, a serious complication of eclampsia. This patient concurrently developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and acute respiratory distress syndrome (the latter presented with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on x-ray and developing pulmonary edema in the absence of cardiac etiology). Because of these life-threatening dynamics, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further treatment. This case is a rare cascade of life-threatening complications that developed in a patient and required skillful multidisciplinary decision making and experienced management within an acute critical care setting. The final outcome of the treatment and intensive care was successful because both the patient and child survived and had no chronic or debilitating sequelae."

Only a small percentage of patients present with symptoms and a surgical treatment is indicated in highly selected cases. A melatonin secretion in patients with a pineal cyst before and after a pineal cyst resection has not been studied yet and the effect of surgery on human metabolism is unknown. The present study examined melatonin, cortisol and blood glucose secretion profiles peri-operatively in a surgical group of 4 patients. The control group was represented by 3 asymptomatic patients with a pineal cyst. For each patient, 24-h circadian secretion curves of melatonin, cortisol and glycemia were acquired. An analysis of melatonin profiles showed an expected diurnal pattern with the night peak in patients before the surgery and in the control group. In contrast, melatonin levels in patients after the surgery were at their minimum throughout the whole 24-h period. The cortisol secretion was substantially increased in patients after the surgery. Blood glucose sampling showed no statistically significant differences. Clinical results demonstrated statistically significant headache relief measured by Visual Analogue Scale in patients after the surgery. Despite the small number of examined patients, we can conclude that patients with a pineal cyst preserved the physiological secretion of the hormone melatonin while patients who underwent the pineal cyst resection experienced a loss of endogenous pineal melatonin production, which equated with pinealectomy. Surprisingly, cortisol secretion substantially increased in patients after the surgery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

How to create comfortable and healthy sleep environments with less energy use is worth exploring. Findings, based on one questionnaire survey on sleep environments conditioned by different cooling modes have been reported. The study investigated the use of different cooling devices in relation to the effect on sleep. Human responses to thermal environments and air quality created by different cooling modes were also studied. Totally 229 completed questionnaires were statistically analysed. The results show that most of the respondents prefer to use air conditioner 3-6 months in a year with relatively low temperature settings especially for respondents living below fifth floor. It is better to choose relatively high temperature settings to reduce air conditioning intensity especially for elders and outdoor workers, which can not only avoid cold thermal discomfort but also reduce electric energy use. For elders, outdoor workers and persons living in higher floor levels, there was an increase usage of electrical fans or natural ventilation. Thermal comfort can be maintained by raised air movement and the perceived air quality could improve obviously by introducing outdoor air, which would create a good sleep environment to ensure sleep quality."

Multiple databases were searched yielding 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the review's inclusion criteria, which were assessed for methodological quality as well as for melatonin effectiveness. The majority of included studies were high quality (83.0%). Overall, according to Grading Recommendations, Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, weak recommendations were made for preventing phase shifts from jet lag, for improving insomnia in both healthy volunteers and individuals with a history of insomnia, and for initiating sleep and/or improving sleep efficacy. Based on the literature to date, no recommendations for use in shift workers or to improve hormonal phase shift changes in healthy people can be made at this time. Larger and longer-duration RCTs utilizing well characterized products are needed to warrant melatonin recommendations in young, healthy adults."

Sleep and regular exercise have been shown to affect brain and cognitive functions, and we investigated the interplay between these two factors on working memory. One hundred participants completed a sleep-exercise log, wore an acti-watch for five days and performed a working memory task on the sixth day. Regular exercisers were found to have significantly faster response time on the working memory task than non-regular exercisers, and such effect was moderated by actigraphy-measured total sleep time. In other words, regular exercisers had faster reaction time than non-regular exercisers only when they had sufficient sleep (>6.5hours). Our findings showed that both healthy sleep and regular exercise habits should be promoted among adolescents and young adults to optimize cognitive development."
1991,Medical , Healthy Sleep  , USA; Adolescents; Sleep perceptions; Health; Culture        ,"Adolescents in the United States are known to be sleep deprived; early school start times, a biological propensity to stay up late, and a variety of wake-inducing activities lead to teens who often do not sleep enough. This chronic lack of sleep has measurable negative effects on health and well-being for adolescents. Though research has documented adolescent sleep behavior, few studies have addressed perceptions of sleep. The purpose of this study was to identify common sources of sleep information for a sample of Southwestern adolescents and examine general message content delivered to adolescents by each source. A convenience sample of 51 adolescents (mean age 14.5) completed a semi-structured, in-person interview between October 2006 and November 2007 in a Tucson, Arizona high school. Participant observation and a brief questionnaire regarding parent behavior were used to triangulate results. Parents, teachers, and in some cases the media stressed the importance of sleep for teens, while friends typically complained of tiredness. Individual experiences of sleep were reported to shape future sleep behavior. Rationales for adequate sleep included value placed on alertness, health, and achievement. Improving sleep in adolescents will not only require further education of the ""sleep messengers"" about the negative health consequences of inadequate sleep, but a larger cultural shift in how healthy sleep for teenagers is conceived and prioritized by schools, families and adolescents themselves.

We aimed to characterize growth patterns, hypoparathyroidism, and thyroid dysfunction of individuals with 22q11.2DS. Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were obtained from the charts of 48 individuals (males=28, 8.0 +/- 6.8 visits/participant) followed at a national 22q11.2DS clinic between 2009 and 2016. Age at diagnosis was 4.3 +/- 4.9 years and age at last evaluation 11.2 +/- 7.2 years. Median height-SDS was negative at all ages. Height-SDS at last visit was correlated to the midparental height-SDS (r=0.52 P=0.002). Yet, participants did not reach their target height, with a difference of 1.06 +/- 1.07 SD (P<0.0001). Height-SDS at last visit of participants with a heart defect was lower compared to participants with a normal heart (-1.5 +/- 1.4 vs. -0.6 +/- 0.8, P=0.036), with lower height-SDS in the subgroup of participants with severe heart defects (-2.1 +/- 1.6, P=0.009). Mean IGF1-SDS was low (-0.99 +/- 1.68) but was not correlated with height-SDS. Thirteen patients (27%) had hypoparathyroidism: 10 presented during infancy and 3 during adolescence. Five patients (10.4%, female=4) had thyroid abnormalities. In conclusions, individuals with 22q11.2 DS have a distinct growth pattern consisting of growth restriction at all ages, resulting in final adult height in the low-normal range. Hypoparathyroidism is common and may present during the neonatal period as well as later in life. Thyroid abnormalities may present during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood."

Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIg) has been extensively used in treating liver injury which is the common adverse reaction of docetaxel (DOC). Due to the narrow therapeutic window, small changes in pharmacokinetic profiles can alter the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of DOC significantly. The study aimed to explore the effects of MgIg on the disposition of DOC and the potential mechanism in DOC-induced liver injury. 2. Pharmacokinetics and tissues distribution behaviors showed that there was no significant difference between DOC group (DOCG) and MgIg+DOC group (MDOCG). The mRNA and protein levels of cytochrome P450 3A1 (CYP3A1) in liver, intestine, and kidney were significantly upregulated, and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was obviously downregulated in MDOCG when compared with DOCG. 3. Immunoglobulin M (IgM), CD8+ were upregulated in DOCG; while in MDOCG, IgM, CD8+ recovered to normal levels and complement C-3; CD4+ were upregulated. 4. MgIg had no significant effects on the disposition of DOC in docetaxel-induced liver injury. Additional, potential drug-drug interaction may happen if MgIg co-administered with antitumor drugs which are the substrates of CYP3A4 or P-gp. Hepatoprotective mechanism of MgIg perhaps was through upregulation of C-3, CD4+ and downregulation of IgM, CD8+."

The anti-HCV core antigen monoclonal antibodies were coated on magnetic microparticles probe (MMP). Then the NP-HCV core antigen-MMP sandwich immunocomplex was formed when the target antigen protein was added and captured. Magnetically separated, the immuno-complex containing the single-stranded barcode signal DNA was characterized by TagMan probe based real-time fluorescence PCR. A detection limit of 1 fg/ml was determined for the HCV core antigen which is magnitude greater than that of ELISA (2 ng/ml). The coefficients of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay respectively ranged from 0.22-2.62% and 1.92-3.01%. The improved GNPA decreased the interference of unbound barcode DNAs and may be an new way for HCV core antigen detection. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V."

The dynamical analysis reveals that the disease-free equilibrium of the model is asymptotically stable if the basic reproductive number R-0 is less than unity. On the other hand, if R-0 >1, the disease is uniformly persistent. Numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the influence of different vital parameters on R-0.

We investigated whether this SNP had any effect on the dynamics of CMV-specific T-cell immunity in these patients. CMV pp65/IE-1 IFN-gamma CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells were enumerated by flow cytometry in 85 patients with no prior CMV DNAemia (group A) and in 57 after the onset of CMV DNAemia (group B). Donor IL28B genotype was determined by real-time PCR and plasma levels of IL-28B were quantitated by ELISA. CMV-specific T-cell counts and plasma IL-28B levels in patients in group A were not significantly different among the IL28B genotype groups. Patients harboring the donor IL28B T/T genotype appeared to expand CMV-specific IFN-gamma CD8(+) cells to a higher level in response to viral replication than their C/T and C/C counterparts. Fewer patients in the T/T group received pre-emptive antiviral therapy (P = 0.05). Overall, a significant inverse correlation was observed between median IL-28B levels measured prior to the CMV DNAemia onset and the level of CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells enumerated after detection of CMV DNAemia (s = -0.471; P = 0.013). In summary, the data suggested that the protective effect attributed to the rs12979860 SNP minor T allele could be mediated, at least in part, by eliciting robust CMV-specific T-cell responses.

Treatment options for acute attacks are variable and used off-label. Successful treatment of the associated lymphoma with rituximab seems to prevent acute attacks in subjects with AAE. The aim of this study was to describe AAE manifestations, its associated diseases, and patients' responses to treatments in a representative cohort. A retrospective nationwide study was conducted in France. The inclusion criteria were recurrent angioedema attacks and an acquired decrease in functional C1INH <50% of the reference value. A total of 92 cases were included, with a median age at onset of 62 years. Facial edema and abdominal pain were the most frequent symptoms. Fifteen patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit because of laryngeal edema, and 1 patient died. Anti-C1INH antibodies were present in 43 patients. The associated diseases were primarily non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=44, with 24 splenic marginal zone lymphomas) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (n=24). Three patients had myeloma, 1 had amyloid light-chain (of immunoglobulin) (AL) amyloidosis, 1 patient had a bronchial adenocarcinoma, and 19 patients had no associated disease. Icatibant relieved the symptoms in all treated patients (n=26), and plasma-derived C1INH concentrate in 19 of 21 treated patients. Six patients experienced thromboembolic events under tranexamic acid prophylaxis. Rituximab prevented angioedema in 27 of 34 patients as a monotherapy or in association with chemotherapy. Splenectomy controlled AAE in 7 patients treated for splenic marginal zone lymphoma. After a median follow-up of 4.2 years, angioedema was on remission in 52 patients. AAE cases are primarily associated with indolent lymphoma-especially splenic marginal zone lymphoma-and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance but not with autoimmune diseases or other conditions.

This approach overlooks a small but important minority of cases in which attacks are bradykinin driven and exhibit poor responsiveness to steroid or anti-histamine therapy. These patients may have a family history of angioedema (hereditary angioedema), or a past medical history including B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune disease (acquired angioedema). Rather than steroid therapy, they respond to administration of a bradykinin inhibitor, or more commonly, a Cl esterase inhibitor substitute, to control acute symptoms and reduce the probability of invasive airway insertion. In the long-term, they require Cl esterase inhibitor sparing therapy and a treat-the-cause approach to reduce the risk of recurrent attacks.

However, development of such a small animal model has been hampered by the unsuitability of rodent cells for HIV-1 replication given that the retrovirus HIV-1 has high selectivity to its host cell. Our study used the mouse leukemia cell lines L615 and L1210 that were induced by murine leukemia virus and transfected with hCD4/CCR5 loaded-lentiviral vector. Lentiviral vectors containing the genes hCD4/CCR5 under the transcriptional control of cytomegalovirus promoter were designed. Transfection efficiencies of human CD4 and CCR5 in L615 and L1210 cells were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assay. Results showed that hCD4 and CCR5 proteins were expressed on the cell surface, demonstrating that the L615 and L1210 cells were humanized and that they possess the characteristics necessary for HIV infection of human host cells. Moreover, the sensitivity of human CD4/CCR5 transgenic mouse cells to HIV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA. Mouse leukemia cell lines that could express hCD4 and CCR5 were thus established to facilitate normal entry of HIV-1 so that a human CD4/CCR5 transgenic mice cell model can be used to investigate the transmission and pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS and potential antiviral drugs against this disease."

Numerical simulations show that, with the current rate of administration of antiretroviral treatment (to HIV-infected individuals), HIV burden decreases with increasing PrEP coverage. Furthermore, for this setting, this study suggests that HIV can be effectively controlled in the MSM population if, in addition to the current rate of administration of anti-retroviral therapy in the community, at least 61-77% (with mean of about 70%) of the susceptible members of the MSM community are on PrEP (adjusted by PrEP efficacy).

Among this group, those residing in rural areas may have less favorable opinions about common HIV testing sites, which could inhibit HIV testing. We examined rural/urban variations in their acceptability of multiple HIV testing sites (private physician clinic, local health department, community health center, community HIV fair, hospital emergency department, blood plasma donation center, drug abuse treatment facility, and mobile van or community outreach worker). Results from partial proportional odds and logistic regression analyses indicate that rural AA who use cocaine have lower odds of viewing local health departments (OR = 0.09, 95 % CI = 0.03-0.21), physician offices (OR = 0.19, 95 % CI = 0.09-0.42), and drug use treatment centers (OR = 0.49; 95 % CI = 0.30-0.80) as acceptable relative to their urban counterparts. The findings have implications for further targeting HIV testing toward AAs who use of cocaine, particularly those residing in the rural South."
2108,Medical , HIV/AIDS  , HIV/AIDS; women; social stigma; Blacks; quality of life; mental health; health disparities        ,"African and Caribbean Black (ACB) women in Canada are disproportionately impacted by new HIV infections. ACB women's HIV vulnerability is shaped by contexts of stigma and discrimination. HIV-related stigma compromises quality of life (QOL) among women living with HIV (WLWH), yet scant research has examined concomitant effects of racial discrimination and HIV-related stigma on QOL. We used data from a cross-sectional survey with ACB WLWH in Ontario (n=173) to test a conceptual model of pathways between HIV-related stigma, racial discrimination, depression, social support, and QOL. We conducted structural equation modeling using maximum likelihood estimation to test the model. In independent models, HIV-related stigma was associated with lower QOL, and depression partially mediated the association between HIV-related stigma and QOL. In the simultaneous model, HIV-related stigma had significant direct effects on depression, social support, and an indirect effect on QOL. When social support was added as a mediator, the direct effect between HIV-related stigma and QOL was no longer significant, suggesting mediation. Racial discrimination had significant direct effects on HIV-related stigma, depression, and social support and an indirect effect on QOL. QOL was associated with higher social support and lower depression scores. The model fit the data well: (2)=203.266, degrees of freedom (DF): 112, p<.0001; Comparative Fit Index (CFI): 0.929, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI): 0.912, Root-Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA): 0.071. We found racial discrimination was associated with increased HIV-related stigma, and HIV-related stigma and racial discrimination compromised QOL. Findings suggest the need for multilevel interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination, address depression, and build social support to improve QOL among ACB WLWH."

Specifically, childbearing women with AIDS face constant psychological difficulties during their gestation period, even though the pregnancy itself may be normal and healthy. These women have to deal with the uncertainties and the stress that usually accompany a pregnancy, and they have to live with the reality of having a life-threatening disease; in addition to that, they also have to deal with discriminating and stigmatizing behaviors from their environment. It is well known that a balanced mental state is a major determining factor to having a normal pregnancy and constitutes the starting point for having a good quality of life. Even though the progress in both technology and medicine is rapid, infected pregnant women seem to be missing this basic requirement. Communities seem unprepared and uneducated to smoothly integrate these people in their societies, letting the ignorance marginalize and isolate these patients. For all the aforementioned reasons, it is imperative that society and medical professionals respond and provide all the necessary support and advice to HIV-positive child bearers, in an attempt to allay their fears and relieve their distress. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the difficulties patients with HIV infection have to deal with, in order to survive and merge into society, identify the main reasons for the low public awareness, discuss the current situation, and provide potential solutions to reducing the stigma among HIV patients."

Although this may be quite rare, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism causing NDPH, migraine, or an exacerbation of pre-existing migraine is not.

Secondary hypothyroidism is a rare cause of pericardial effusion and tamponade, but an important differential to consider. Management requires appropriate hormone replacement and, critically, a low threshold for commencing stress dose steroids. Clinical signs classically associated with cardiac tamponade are frequently absent in cases of tamponade due to primary and secondary hypothyroidism, and the relatively volume deplete state of secondary hypoadrenalism in hypopituitarism may further mask an evolving tamponade, as the rise in right atrial pressure is less marked even in the presence of large effusion. Our case demonstrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for cardiac tamponade in this patient cohort, even in the absence of clinical signs, and for measuring both thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels when evaluating a pericardial effusion."
1491,Medical , Hypothyroidism  , GC-MS metabolomic data validation and normalization; Mammalian brain metabolism; Adult-onset hypothyroidism (AOH); Balb/cJ mouse cerebellum; Metabolic network analysis; Systems biology        ,"A systematic data quality validation and normalization strategy is an important component of the omic profile meta-analysis, ensuring comparability of the profiles and exclusion of experimental biases from the derived biological conclusions. In this study, we present the normalization methodology applied on the sets of cerebellum gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolic profiles of 124 days old male and female animals in an adult-onset-hypothyroidism (AOH) mouse model before combining them into a sex-comparative analysis. The employed AOH model concerns the monitoring of the brain physiology of Balb/cJ mice after eight-week administration of 1%w/v KClO4 in the drinking water, initiated on the 60th day of their life. While originating from the same animal study, the tissues of the two sexes were processed and their profiles acquired and analyzed at different time periods. Hence, the previously published profile set of male mice was first re-annotated based on the presently available resources. Then, after being validated as acquired under the same analytical conditions, both profiles sets were corrected for derivatization biases and filtered for low-confidence measurements based on the same criteria. The final normalized 73-metabolite profiles contribute to the currently few available omic datasets of the AOH effect on brain molecular physiology, especially with respect to sex differentiation. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated one (unknown) and three (succinate, benzoate, myristate) metabolites with significantly higher and lower, respectively, cerebellum concentration in the hypothyroid compared to the euthyroid female mice. The respective numbers for the males were two and 24. Comparison of the euthyroid cerebellum metabolic profiles between the two sexes indicated 36 metabolites, including glucose, myo- and scyllo-inositol, with significantly lower concentration in the females versus the males. This implies that the female mouse cerebellum has been conditioned to smaller changes in its metabolic activity with respect to the pathways involving these metabolites compared to the male animals. In conclusion, our study indicated a much subtler AOH effect on the cerebellum metabolic activity of the female compared to the male mice. The leaner metabolic profile of the female mouse cerebellum was suggested as a potential factor contributing to this phenomenon. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Clinical symptoms and signs are often nonspecific, particularly in hypothyroidism. Muscular symptoms (stiffness, myalgias, cramps, easy fatigability) are mentioned by the majority of patients with frank hypothyroidism. Often underestimated is the fact that muscle symptoms may represent the predominant or the only clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism, raising the issue of a differential diagnosis with other causes of myopathy, which sometimes can be difficult. Elevated serum creatine kinase, which not necessarily correlates with the severity of the myopathic symptoms, is certainly suggestive of muscle impairment, though it does not explain the cause. Rare muscular manifestations, associated with hypothyroidism, are rhabdomyolysis, acute compartment syndrome, Hoffman's syndrome and Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome. Though the pathogenesis of hypothyroid myopathy is not entirely known, proposed mechanisms include altered glycogenolytic and oxidative metabolism, altered expression of contractile proteins, and neuro-mediated damage. Correlation studies of haplotype, muscle gene expression and protein characterization, could help understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of this myopathic presentation of hypothyroidism."

However, the molecular basis for this observation still remains to be fully understood. Here, we show that L-Thyroxine significantly impaired human sperm motility. The molecular basis showed that thyroxine receptor stimulation triggers Phosphatidyl Inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling activation leading to the E3 ligase MDM2 phosphorylation at serine 166, which directly interacted with p53 for degradation. p53 degradation caused a p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint or repair dysfunction, which eventually results in DNA damage accumulation in sperm. Our results highlight that inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway or p53 degradation is important in maintaining sperm motility in a thyroxine receptor (TR)-dependent manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

As caveolin (Cav)-null mice develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), we hypothesized that the participating fibroblasts display an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. To test this hypothesis and identify the molecular mechanisms involved we isolated lung fibroblasts from Cav-null mice and examined the expression of several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), of c-FLIP, of Bcl-2 proteins and of the death receptor CD95/Fas. We found significant increase in XIAP and c-FLIP constitutive protein expression with no alteration of Bcl-2 and lower levels of CD95/Fas. The isolated fibroblasts were then treated with the CD95/Fas ligand (FasL) to induce apoptosis. While the morphological and biochemical alterations induced by FasL were similar in wild-type (wt) and Cav-null mouse lung fibroblasts, the time course and the extent of the alterations were greater in the Cav-null fibroblasts. Several salient features of Cav-null fibroblasts response such as loss of membrane potential, fragmentation of the mitochondrial continuum concurrent with caspase-8 activation, and subsequent Bid cleavage, prior to caspase-3 activation were detected. Furthermore, M30 antigen formation, phosphatidylserine expression and DNA fragmentation were caspase-3 dependent. SiRNA-mediated silencing of XIAP and c-FLIP, individually or combined, enhanced the sensitivity of lung fibroblasts to FasL-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 had no effect. Together our findings support a mechanism in which CD95/Fas engagement activates caspase-8, inducing mitochondrial apoptosis through Bid cleavage. XIAP and c-FLIP fine tune this process in a cell-type specific manner."

It can substantially change the biological identity of nanomaterials and possibly trigger adverse responses from the body tissues. Dissecting the role of the corona in the development of a particular disease may provide profound insights for understanding toxicity of nanomaterials in general. In our present study, we explored the capability of different silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to induce silicosis in the mouse lung and analyzed the composition of coronas formed on these particles. We found that SiNPs of certain size and surface chemistry could specifically recruit transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)intotheircorona, which subsequently induces the development of lung fibrosis. Once embedded into the corona on SiNPs, TGF-beta l was remarkably more stable than in its free form, and its fibrosis-triggering activity was significantly prolonged. Our study meaningfully demonstrates that a specific corona component on a certain nanoparticle could initiate a particular pathogenic process in a clinically relevant disease model. Our findings may shed light on the understanding of molecular mechanisms of human health risks correlated with exposure to small-scale substances."

Kallistatin is an anti-angiogenic peptide with known effects on endothelial cells. This study aimed to demonstrate that kallistatin has beneficial effects on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in a rat model by inhibiting angiogenesis. Twenty-five rats were randomly divided into five experimental groups: (A) Saline only (SA)-as the negative control, (B) BLM only (BLM)-as the model group, (C) BLM and 0.1 mg/kg kallistatin (L-Kal), (D) BLM and 0.5 mg/kg kallistatin (M-Kal), and (E) BLM and 2.5 mg/kg kallistatin (H-Kal). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a-smooth-muscle-actin (alpha-SMA) and microvascular density (MVD) were measured by immunohistochemistry. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were assayed by Western immunoblotting or ELISA. Daily administration of kallistatin attenuated fibrosis in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as shown by histology. During inflammation from BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, kallistatin reduced the number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Kallistatin also inhibited VEGF expression and phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Flk-1). In vitro, kallistatin blocked tube formation by inhibiting Flk-1 and GSK-3 beta phosphorylation. The results demonstrated that continuous administration of kallistatin attenuated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and improved survival of BLM rats. Reducing pulmonary fibrosis was achieved by partial inhibition of pulmonary inflammation and angiogenesis."

They carry a significant mortality and morbidity and while their exact pathogenesis remains unclear, the possibility remains that hidden infection may play a role. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether changes in the respiratory microbiota occur during an AE-IPF. Bacterial DNA was extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with stable IPF and those experiencing an AE-IPF. A hyper-variable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rRNA) was amplified, quantified and pyrosequenced. Culture independent techniques demonstrate AE-IPF is associated with an increased BAL bacterial burden compared to stable disease and highlight shifts in the composition of the respiratory microbiota during an AE-IPF."

Indeed, adenosine 5;-triphosphate (ATP) can bind to PRs which are found in the membrane of many cell types, although the relative proportions of the receptor subtypes differ. PRs are classified according to genetic and pharmacological criteria and especially their affinities for agonists and their transduction mechanism (i.e. as metabotropic P2YRs or ionotropic P2XRs). Extracellular ATP release by activated or necrotic cells may activate various PRs and especially P2X7R, the best-characterized PR, on immune cells. P2X7R is known to regulate the activation of the Nod-like receptor (NLR)-family protein, NLRP3 inflammasome, which permit the release of IL-1b, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine. The P2X7R/NLRP3 pathway is involved in many inflammatory diseases, such as gout, and in fibrosis diseases associated with inflammatory process, liver or lung fibrosis. Some authors imaging also a real promising therapeutic potential of P2X7R blockage. Thus, several pharmaceutical companies have developed P2X7R antagonists as novel anti-inflammatory drug candidates. Clinical trials of the efficacy of these antagonists are now underway. A better understanding of the P2X7R/NLRP3 signalling pathways permits the identification of targets and the development of a new class of drugs able to inhibit the fibrogenesis process and collagen deposition."

After routine gastrointestinal investigations, she was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. Over six months, she developed occasional facial flushing prompting assessment of neuroendocrine tumour markers. Urinary 5HIAA, 5HT, chromogranin A and neurokinin A were significantly elevated. Scans showed extensive hepatic metastases but did not show the location of a primary tumour. Somatostatin analogue therapy was commenced but despite increasing doses, symptoms increased and biomarkers rose dramatically. Interferon alpha was introduced concomitant with somatostatin analogue therapy. Biomarkers were monitored regularly. Within six months, symptoms abated and biomarkers reduced, continuing to fall over the next year, close to reference range. To manage side-effects of interferon alpha, dose was reduced from time to time. During these short periods, neurokinin A showed significant transient increases (75-150ng/L) and carcinoid symptoms returned. For more than seven years, and with the co-operation of the patient, a balance was achieved between interferon alpha side-effects and disease control. Scans showed tumour load to be stable. The patient survived for 10 years post diagnosis. She chose to discontinue interferon alpha and received peptide receptor radiation therapy in her final year. Throughout, neurokinin A remained the most sensitive monitor of her disease progression."

The diet has gained traction since its original description in Australia 10 years ago and is now an internationally accepted dietary management strategy for IBS. Randomized controlled trials have raised the profile of the low-FODMAP diet to become a viable first-line therapy for IBS, when implemented under a dietitian's guidance. Importantly, the diagnosis of IBS should be confirmed before commencement of the dietary approach. The skill set of the dietitian is then paramount to the success of the diet. Experience in gastrointestinal disorder management, consideration of symptom types, severity, baseline FODMAP intake, and overall nutritional content and meal pattern are vital in the assessment of the patient. If a strict low-FODMAP diet is deemed necessary, it should only be for an initial period of 4 to 6 weeks. Research suggests that a strict long-term, low-FODMAP diet may negatively impact intestinal microbiome. After the initial strict period, follow up with the dietitian should be conducted to achieve the overall goal-a relaxed FODMAP restriction that enables inclusion of prebiotic FODMAPs while still maintaining symptom relief. The diet will be effective in the vast majority of patients. For those in which it fails, FODMAPs should be reintroduced to the diet, and other dietary (or non-dietary) approaches should be considered."

To determine the accuracy of this approach, we analyzed data from 10 double-blind, placebo-controlled, gluten-challenge trials, comprising 1312 adults. The studies varied in the duration of the challenge (range, 1 d to 6 wk), daily doses for the gluten challenge (range, 2-52 g; 3 studies administered <8 g/d), and composition of the placebo (gluten-free products, xylose, whey protein, rice, or corn starch containing fermentable carbohydrates). Most of the studies found gluten challenge to significantly increase symptom scores compared with placebo. However, only 38 of 231 NCGS patients (16%) showed gluten-specific symptoms. Furthermore, 40% of these subjects had a nocebo response (similar or increased symptoms in response to placebo). These findings reveal heterogeneity and potential methodology flaws among studies of gluten challenge, cast doubt on gluten as the culprit food component in most patients with presumptive NCGS, and highlight the importance of the nocebo effect in these types of studies."

The gut-brain axis hormones ghrelin and leptin, with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may affect QoL of CD patients undergoing GFD. Our aims were to evaluate whether: (a) the circulating concentrations of leptin, ghrelin and BDNF in CD patients were different from those in healthy subjects; (b) GFD might induce changes in their levels; (c) BDNF Val66Met polymorphism variability might affect BDNF levels; and (d) serum BDNF levels were related to dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as a neurotrophin modulator. Nineteen adult coeliac patients and 21 healthy controls were included. A QoL questionnaire was administered, and serum concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, BDNF and red blood cell membrane DHA levels were determined at the enrolment and after 1 year of GFD. BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was analysed. Results from the questionnaire indicated a decline in QoL after GFD. Ghrelin and leptin levels were not significantly different between groups. BDNF levels were significantly (p = 0.0213) lower in patients after GFD (22.0 +/- 2.4 ng/ml) compared to controls (31.2 +/- 2.2 ng/ml) and patients at diagnosis (25.0 +/- 2.5 ng/ml). BDNF levels correlated with DHA levels (p = 0.008, r = 0.341) and the questionnaire total score (p = 0.041, r = 0.334). Ghrelin and leptin seem to not be associated with changes in QoL of patients undergoing dietetic treatment. In contrast, a link between BDNF reduction and the vulnerability of CD patients to psychological distress could be proposed, with DHA representing a possible intermediate."

Understanding the role of 'place' as a barrier to accessing care and the lived experiences of Aboriginal patients emerged as key research priorities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
1908,Medical , Kidney Health  , Acute kidney injury; chronic kidney injury; matrix metalloproteinase-8; renal failure        ,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) leads to chronic kidney disease. The mechanisms involved with recovery from AKI are poorly understood and molecular mediators responsible for healing and restoration of kidney function are understudied. We previously discovered differential expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) mRNA and protein in patients with severe sepsis associated AKI versus sepsis without AKI. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of MMP-8 in purely ischemic AKI. Mice subjected to 30 min of bilateral renal ischemia developed increased plasma creatinine and MMP-8 expression within 24 h versus sham controls. After an initial surge and subsequent return toward baseline, both kidney MMP-8 expression and activity exhibited a late increase (Days 5-7 post-ischemia reperfusion) in mice subjected to AKI. Neutrophil infiltration of the kidney was significantly higher after AKI in wild-type mice than in MMP-8 null mice, starting at 4 days. Additionally, MMP-8 null mice subjected to AKI demonstrated a persistent histopathologic and functional injury and worsened health (greater overall weight loss) versus wild-type cohorts after seven days. Taken together, our findings suggest that MMP-8 is involved with restoration of baseline kidney health after ischemic kidney injury and that a potential mechanism involves the interaction of MMP-8 and neutrophil recruitment to the site of injury."

MethodsA total of 2163 patients prescribed at least one of the 31 renally cleared drugs under review were included in the study. Kidney function was estimated using the three equations. We compared actual prescribed dosages of the same drug with recommended dosages based on the kidney function as calculated by each of the equations and applying dosing recommendations in the Australian Medicines Handbook. ResultsThere was a significant difference in the kidney function values estimated from the three equations (P<0.001). Despite the good overall agreement in renal drug dosing, we found selected but potentially important discrepancies among the doses rendered from the equations. The CKD-EPI equation non-normalized for body surface area had a greater rate of concordance with the Cockcroft-Gault equation than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation for renal drug dosing. ConclusionsThere is need for a long-term multi-centre study in a diverse population to define the clinical effects of the discrepancies among the equations for drug dosing. Given the greater concordance of the non-normalized CKD-EPI equation with the Cockcroft-Gault equation for dosing, the recommendation by Kidney Health Australia and the United States National Kidney Disease Education Program that dosing based on either eCrCl or an eGFR with body surface area normalization removed are acceptable' seems suitable and practicable for the purpose of dosing of non-critical drugs in the primary care setting."

MethodsA workshop involving three concurrent focus groups with 18 consumers (patients with ADPKD (n=15), caregivers (n=3)) was convened. Guideline topics, interventions and outcomes were identified, and integrated into guideline development. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the reasons for their choices. ResultsTwenty-two priority topics were identified, with most focussed on non-pharmacological management (diet, fluid intake, physical activity, complementary medicine), pain management and psychosocial care (mental health, counselling, cognitive and behavioural training, education, support groups). They also identified 26 outcomes including quality of life (QoL), progression of kidney disease, kidney function, cyst growth and nephrotoxity. Almost all topics and outcomes suggested were identified by health professionals with the exception of five topics/outcomes. Six themes reflected reasons for their choices: clarifying ambiguities, resolving debilitating pain, concern for family, preparedness for the future, taking control and significance of impact. ConclusionAlthough there was considerable concordance between the priority topics and outcomes of health professionals and consumers for guidelines of ADPKD, there was also important discordance with consumers focused on fewer issues, but particularly on lifestyle, psychosocial support, pain, and QoL and renal outcomes. Active consumer engagement in guidelines development can help to ensure the inclusion of patient-centred recommendations, which may lead to better management of disease progression, symptoms, complications, and psychosocial impact."

A frameshift in patient care delivery is underway in kidney health care in the United States with a Medicare education benefit for patients with stage 4 CKD. This Medicare benefit is a unique program that has the potential to inform patients and families about CKD and prepare them for transitions in health states and kidney health care. For the greatest value of this benefit to be realized, it is critical for the health care community to accurately gauge patient understanding of CKD and provide curricula that are comprehensible and actionable for patients.

52,Medical , Low Testosterone  , Chlamydiae; disease ecology; immunocompetence handicap hypothesis; microbiome; sexually transmitted disease; testosterone        ,"1. Testosterone mediates several key aspects of male reproduction, but maintaining high testosterone levels can reduce long-term survival. One of the proposed pathways by which testosterone can influence survival is through increased risk of parasite infection. The hormone has the potential to affect the transmission of sexually transmitted infections by promoting behaviours that increase sexual contact rates and/or by decreasing immune function. 2. We hypothesized that males with high concentrations of testosterone would increase their chances of being infected with sexually transmitted bacteria, which would manifest as increased diversity of cloacal bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we measured circulating testosterone concentrations in breeding male rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) and collected cloacal swabs to quantify bacterial diversity using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. 3. There was a positive correlation between testosterone concentrations and the phylogenetic diversity of cloacal bacteria. In addition, individuals with high and medium testosterone concentrations had cloacal bacterial communities that were more similar to each other than to those of low testosterone individuals. Finally, when considering bacterial taxa that are potential avian pathogens, we found that the relative abundance of Chlamydiae, a class of obligate intracellular parasites, was positively correlated with testosterone concentrations. 4. Two non-exclusive explanations for these results are that testosterone affects behaviours that lead to increased sexual contacts and thus the exposure and acquisition of additional phylogenetically diverse bacteria, and/or that testosterone is altering the immune system or the cloacal environment, thus making it easier for bacteria to colonize. Either way, these data suggest that increased exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens in the form of cloacal bacteria could be a cost of maintaining high testosterone levels."
64,Medical , Low Testosterone  , 17 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3; 46   XY DSD; Ambiguous genitalia; Gender role; Testosterone synthesis defect; HSD17B3 gene; Germ cell tumor       ,"17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency consists of a defect in the last phase of steroidogenesis, in which androstenedione is converted into testosterone and estrone into estradiol. External genitalia range from female-like to atypical genitalia and most affected males are raised as females. Virilization in subjects with 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency occurs at the time of puberty and several of them change to male social sex. In male social sex patients, testes can be safely maintained, as long as they are positioned inside the scrotum The phenotype of 46,XY DSD due to 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency is extremely variable and clinically indistinguishable from other causes of 46,XY DSD such as partial androgen insensitivity syndrome and 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. Laboratory diagnosis is based on a low testosterone/androstenedione ratio due to high serum levels of androstenedione and low levels of testosterone. The disorder is caused by a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the HSD17B3 gene that encodes the 17 beta-HSD3 isoenzyme leading to an impairment of the conversion of 17-keto into 17-hydroxysteroids. Molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and provides the orientation for genetic counseling. Our proposal in this article is to review-the previously reported cases of 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency adding our own cases. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Mutations in. the HSD17B3 gene causing 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency are responsible for a rare recessive form of 46, XY Disorders of Sex Development (46, XY DSD). We report novel cases of Tunisian patients with 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency due to previously reported mutations, i.e. p.C206X and p.G133R, as well as a case with the novel compound heterozygous mutations p.C206X and p.Q176P. Moreover, the previously reported polymorphism p.G289S was identified in a heterozygous state in combination with a novel non-coding variant c.54G >T, also in a heterozygous state, in a male patient presenting with micropenis and low testosterone levels. The identification of four different mutations in a cohort of eight patients confirms the generally observed genetic heterogeneity of 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency. Nevertheless, analysis of DNA from 272 randomly selected healthy controls from the same geographic area (region of Sfax) revealed a high carrier frequency for the p.C206X mutation of approximately 1 in 40. Genotype reconstruction of the affected pedigree members revealed that all p. C206X mutation carriers harbored the same haplotype, indicating inheritance of the mutation from a common ancestor. Thus, the identification of a founder effect and the elevated carrier frequency of the p. C206X mutation emphasize the importance to consider this mutation in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of affected 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency pedigrees in Tunisia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The diagnosis can be missed in early childhood as the clinical presentation may be subtle. The most frequent presentation of 17 HSD-3 deficiency is a 46,XY individual with female external genitalia, labial fusion and a blind ending vagina, with or without clitoromegaly. A low testosterone/androstenedion (T/A) ratio is suggestive of 17 beta HSD-3 deficiency, and such diagnosis can be confirmed with molecular genetic studies. A 12-day newborn was referred to our hospital because of palpable gonads in the labia majora. On physical examination, the baby had female external genitalia and palpable gonads in the labia majora. T/A ratio was 0.26 and the diagnosis was 17 beta HSD-3 deficiency, which was confirmed by the evidence of compound heterozygousity novel frameshift mutations in exon 9 and 10 of HSD17B3 gene."

Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated a well-circumscribed mass lesion with heterogeneous density measuring 2.2 cm in diameter located between the second segment of the duodenum and uncinate process of the pancreas. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed no remarkable findings in the remnant stomach; however, the scope could not reach the duodenum due to altered anatomy by Roux-en-Y reconstruction after the distal gastrectomy. The patient underwent surgical resection of the mass lesion under the clinical diagnosis of MALT lymphoma relapse. An orange calculus was apparent in the thinly extended duodenal wall on stretching, and the hall was closed by meticulous primary suture after the duodenal resection. Macroscopically, the extracted calculus was solid and quite hard, measured 2.2 x 2.1 x 2.1 cm, and the cut surface revealed a layered structure in the outer areas with granulated contents in the center. Although duodenal diverticula are relatively common, an enterolith developing within a juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum is rare, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such case due to altered anatomy after gastrectomy reported in the English literature."

He was consistently DNA positive but took 2 years to fully seroconvert. Sequencing of the HTLV-II strain in his cultured T lymphocytes indicated that it is a prototypical type A strain with no major differences in the long terminal repeat DNA sequence, nor major amino acid differences in the Gag, Env, Tax, and Rex proteins. However, a mutation in its pol gene created a stop codon at amino acid 543 of the Pol protein, a region that encodes for the RNase function. This mutation may account for the subject's slow seroconversion."

Eighteen treated patients were evaluable for response. The MTD was 1.3mg/m(2) bortezomib and 10mg/m(2) romidepsin; median treatment duration was 3 cycles at this dose. The dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 fatigue, vomiting, and chills. Two patients had partial responses, one lasting>2 years, 8 had stable disease, and 8 had progressive disease. The median duration of stable disease was 3.5 cycles. Correlative studies examining expression of NF-kappa B, XIAP, Bcl-xL, and Bim yielded variable results.

The workshop was structured into four sessions: (1) blood sciences; (2) exosome therapeutics; (3) next generation in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) models; and (4) BBB delivery and targeting. The first day of the workshop focused on the physiology of the blood and neuro-vascular unit, blood or biofluid-based molecular markers, extracellular vesicles associated with brain injury, and how these entities can be employed to better evaluate injury states and/or deliver therapeutics. The second day of the workshop focused on technical advances in in vitro models, BBB manipulations and nanoparticle-based drug carrier designs, with the goal of improving drug delivery to the central nervous system. The presentations and discussions underscored the role of the BBI in brain injury, as well as the role of the BBB as both a limiting factor and a potential conduit for drug delivery to the brain. At the conclusion of the meeting, the participants discussed challenges and opportunities confronting BBI translational researchers. In particular, the participants recommended using BBI translational research to stimulate advances in diagnostics, as well as targeted delivery approaches for detection and therapy of both brain injury and disease."

Fifty-four percent were African American, 32% Caucasian, 8% Arabic, 3% Hispanic, and 3% Others. Government-sponsored insurance (Medicaid/Medicare) was utilized by 73%,and 54% had dual caregivers. Only nine of 68 kidney transplants were live donor transplants. Live donor transplants (11%) were significantly (P=.008) lower than deceased donor transplants (59%) in African Americans. Private insurance was reported by 56% of live donor recipients and 25% of deceased donor recipients. Among live donor recipients, 78% were from dual caregiver families. Caregiver, health-related, financial, and religious/cultural barriers to live donor transplants were reported, several of which may be amenable to positive intervention."

Proposals for switching to a saving-for-retirement system that does not rely on high payroll taxes have been challenged on the grounds that welfare would fall for some groups such as retirees or the working poor. We show how to devise a transition path from the current U.S. system to a saving-for-retirement system that increases the welfare of all current and future generations, with estimates of future gains higher than those found in typically used macroeconomic models. The gains are large because there is more productive capital than commonly assumed. Our quantitative results depend importantly on accounting for differences between actual government tax revenues and what revenues would be if all income were taxed at the income-weighted average marginal tax rates used in our analysis."

We found the estimations of the incidence of MRSA infections varied widely depending upon the type of population studied, the types of infections captured and in the definitions and terminology used to describe the results. We could not find definitive evidence that the incidence of MRSA infections in U.S. community or facilities is decreasing significantly. Of concern are recent data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) on MRSA bloodstream infections which indicate that by the end of 2015 there had been little change in the average facility Standardized Infection Ratio (0.988), compared to a 2010-2011 baseline and is significantly increased compared to the previous year. This is in contradistinction to the recent Veterans Administration study which reported over an 80% reduction in MRSA infections. However, this discrepancy may be due to the inability to reconcile the baselines of the two data sets; and the observed increase may be artifactual due to aberrations in the NHSN tracking system. Our review supports the need for implementation of a comprehensive tracking and monitoring system involving all types of healthcare facilities for multi-drug resistant organisms, along with concomitant funding for both staff and infrastructure. Without such a system, determining the effectiveness of interventions such as antibiotic stewardship and chlorhexidine bathing will be hindered."

Two-year persistence and compliance rates were higher in women receiving injectables compared with oral agents. Purpose This study extends previous studies limited to 1-year follow-up by examining persistence with osteoporosis therapies over a 2-year period and compares short-and long-term trends in persistence and compliance among postmenopausal women with commercial or Medicare supplemental insurance in the USA. Methods This retrospective, observational cohort study enrolled women >= 50 years newly initiating osteoporosis therapy between January 1 and December 31, 2012 (i.e., the index date), with continuous enrollment >= 14 months before and >= 24 months after their index date. Persistence (continuous therapy without a >60-day gap) and compliance with the index therapy were evaluated at 2 years of follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare the odds of persistence and compliance across treatment and dosing regimens. Results This study included 43,543 patients with mean (standard deviation) age 65 (10) years. At 2 years of follow-up, persistence and compliance were higher for patients treated with injectable agents (ranging from 34 to 41%, excluding an every-3-month injection) than those treated with oral agents (ranging from 20 to 31%). Additionally, patients initiating oral bisphosphonates (except risedronate once daily), raloxifene (daily), or zoledronic acid (annually) had significantly lower odds of persistence compared with denosumab (every 6 months). Conclusions Patients initiating injectable therapies had greater persistence and compliance at 2 years than those initiating oral therapies. Patients initiating an every-6-month injection had significantly higher persistence compared with those initiating more frequently dosed (e.g., daily and weekly) oral or injectable agents."

Methods: A retrospective claims analysis of the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file was conducted to identify all hospitalizations for gastroduodenal ulcer bleeding in the year 2012. The main outcome measures were to compare all-cause mortality, total length of hospital stay (LOS), hospital costs and payment between patients managed with one upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy versus more than one UGI endoscopy or requiring interventional radiology-guided hemostasis (IRH) or surgery after failed endoscopic attempt. Results: The MedPAR claims data evaluated 13,501 hospitalizations, of which 12,242 (90.6%) reported one UGI endoscopy, 817 (6.05%) reported >1 UGI endoscopy, 303 (2.24%) reported IRH after failed endoscopy and 139 (1.03%) reported surgeries after failed endoscopy. All cause-mortality was significantly lower for patients who underwent only one UGI endoscopy (3%) compared to patients requiring >1 endoscopy (6%), IRH (9%) or surgery (14%), p1 endoscopy (eight days), IRH (nine days) or surgery (15 days), p1 endoscopy ($20,055), IRH ($34,730) or surgery ($47,589), p < 0.0001. Conclusions: Failure to achieve hemostasis at the index endoscopy has significant clinical and cost implications. When feasible, a repeat endoscopy must be attempted followed by IRH. Surgery should preferably be reserved as a last resort for patients who fail other treatment measures."
96,Medical , Menopause  , Aging; Female; Metabolism; Ovarian failure; Senescence; Steroid hormones        ,"4-vinilcyclohexene diepoxide (4-VCD) causes premature ovarian failure and may result in estrogen deficiency, characterizing the transition to estropause in rodents (equivalent to menopause in women). Estropause/menopause is associated with metabolic derangements such as glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known to exert diabetogenic effects. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether rats with premature ovarian failure are more prone to the diabetogenic effects of GC. For this, immature female rats received daily injections of 4-VCD [160 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), intraperitoneally (i.p.)] for 15 consecutive days, whereas control rats received vehicle. After 168 days of the completion of 4-VCD administration, rats were divided into 4 groups: CTL-received daily injections of saline (1 mL/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5 days; DEX-received daily injections of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5 days; VCD-treated as CTL group; VCD + DEX-treated as DEX group. Experiments and euthanasia occurred one day after the last dexamethasone injection. 4-VCD-treated rats exhibited ovary hypotrophy and reduced number of preantral follicles (p < 0.05). Premature ovarian failure had no impact on the body weight gain or food intake, but both were reduced by the effects of dexamethasone. The increase in blood glucose, plasma insulin and triacylglycerol levels as well as the reduction in insulin sensitivity caused by dexamethasone treatment was not exacerbated in the VCD + DEX group of rats. Premature ovarian failure did change neither the hepatic content of glycogen and triacylglycerol nor the glycerol release from perigonadal adipose tissue. Glucose intolerance was observed in the VCD group after an ipGIT (p < 0.05), but not after an oral glucose challenge. Glucose intolerance and compensatory pancreatic beta-cell mass caused by GC were not modified by ovarian failure in the VCD + DEX group. We conclude that reduced ovarian function has no major implications on the diabetogenic effects promoted by GC treatment, indicating that other factors related to aging may make rats more vulnerable to GC side effects on glucose metabolism.

A number of studies highlighted a positive correlation between magnesium administration and relief or prevention of these symptoms, thus suggesting that magnesium supplementation may represent a viable treatment for these conditions. Despite this amount of evidence describing the efficacy of magnesium, few and un-systematize data are available about the pharmacological mechanism of this ion for these conditions. Herein, we review and systematize the available evidence about the use of oral magnesium supplementation in several gynecological conditions and discuss the pharmacological mechanisms that characterize these interventions. The picture that emerges indicates that magnesium supplementation is effective in the prevention of dysmenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, and menstrual migraine and in the prevention of climacteric symptoms."

If pregnancy is not desired, contraception always should be discussed. In most patients, the etiology of POI will not be known, but the treatment for all patients includes estrogen and progesterone therapy, which ensures the development of secondary sex characteristics, acquisition of peak bone mass, and promotion of uterine growth and maturation.

In addition to a decreased quality of life, vasomotor symptoms may have an impact on overall health. Vasomotor symptoms are associated with overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, and sympathetic overdrive in turn is associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Menopausal hot flushes have a complex relationship to different features of the metabolic syndrome and not all data point towards an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic syndrome. Thus, it is still unclear whether vasomotor symptoms are an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Research in this area is constantly evolving and we present here the most recent data on the possible association between menopausal vasomotor symptoms and the metabolic syndrome.

However, few studies have focused on the gray matter alterations of Trigeminal neuralgia (TN). In this study, twenty-eight TN patients (thirteen females; mean age, 45.86 years +/- 11.17) and 28 healthy controls (HC; thirteen females; mean age, 44.89 years +/- 7.67) were included. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we detected abnormalities in gray matter volume in the TN patients. Based on a voxel-wise analysis, the TN group showed significantly decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral superior/middle temporal gyrus (STG/MTG), bilateral parahippocampus, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), caudate nucleus, right fusiform gyrus, and right cerebellum compared with the HC. In addition, we found that the gray matter volume in the bilateral STG/MTG was negatively correlated with the duration of TN. These results provide compelling evidence for gray matter abnormalities in TN and suggest that the duration of TN may be a critical factor associated with brain alterations."
2065,Medical , Migraine  , fMRI; Rat; Migraine; Inflammatory soup; Resting state networks        ,"Advances in our understanding of the human pain experience have shifted much of the focus of pain research from the periphery to the brain. Current hypotheses suggest that the progression of migraine depends on abnormal functioning of neurons in multiple brain regions. Accordingly, we sought to capture functional brain changes induced by the application of an inflammatory cocktail known as inflammatory soup (IS), to the dura mater across multiple brain networks. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether IS alters additional neural networks indirectly related to the primary nociceptive pathways via the spinal cord to the thalamus and cortex. IS comprises an acidic combination of bradykinin, serotonin, histamine and prostaglandin PGE2 and was introduced to basic pain research as a tool to activate and sensitize peripheral nociceptors when studying pathological pain conditions associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. Using this model of intracranial pain, we found that dural application of IS in awake, fully conscious, rats enhanced thalamic, hypothalamic, hippocampal and somatosensory cortex responses to mechanical stimulation of the face (compared to sham synthetic interstitial fluid administration). Furthermore, resting state MRI data revealed altered functional connectivity in a number of networks previously identified in clinical chronic pain populations. These included the default mode, sensorimotor, interoceptive (Salience) and autonomic networks. The findings suggest that activation and sensitization of meningeal nociceptors by IS can enhance the extent to which the brain processes nociceptive signaling, define new level of modulation of affective and cognitive responses to pain; set new tone for hypothalamic regulation of autonomic outflow to the cranium; and change cerebellar functions.

We recruited 155 patients with definite Meniere Disease and 186 controls (Control Group 1) without a lifetime history of vertigo, overlapping with patients for age and rate of hypertension. We validated the positive results on 413 Caucasian subjects selected from a European general population (Control Group 2). The clinical history for migraine and hypertension was collected; genomic DNA was characterized for a panel of 33 SNPs encoding proteins involved in ionic transport. We found a higher rate of migraineurs in MD subjects compared to Group 1 (46.8 vs 15.5%, p = 0.00005). Four SNPs displayed differences in MD patients compared to Group 1 controls: rs3746951 and rs2838301 in SIK1 gene, rs434082 and rs487119 in SLC8A1; the p values of Chi-squared test for genotype frequencies are 0.009, 0.023, 0.009 and 0.048, respectively. SLC8A1 gene encodes for Na+-Ca++ exchanger, while SIK1 gene encodes for Salt Inducible Kinase 1, an enzyme associated with Na+-K+ ATPase function. The validation with Control Group 2 displayed that only rs3746951 and rs487119 are strongly associated to MD (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0004, respectively). These data support the hypothesis that a genetically induced dysfunction of ionic transport may act as a predisposing factors to develop MD."

Besides L-type channels, T-and P/Q-type calcium channels are involved in the contraction of human renal blood vessels. It was hypothesized that T-and P/Q-type channels are involved in the contraction of human brain and mammary blood vessels. Methods: Internal mammary arteries from bypass surgery patients and cerebral arterioles from patients with brain tumours with and without hypertension were tested in a myograph and perfusion set-up. PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed on isolated blood vessels. Results: The P/Q-type antagonist x-agatoxin IVA (10(-8) mol L-1) and the T-type calcium blocker mibefradil (10(-7) mol L-1) inhibited KCl depolarization- induced contraction in mammary arteries from hypertensive patients with no effect on blood vessels from normotensive patients. omega-Agatoxin IVA decreased contraction in cerebral arterioles from hypertensive patients. L-type blocker nifedipine abolished the contraction in mammary arteries. PCR analysis showed expression of P/Q-type (Ca(v)2.1), Ttype (Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2) and L-type (Ca(v)1.2) calcium channels in mammary and cerebral arteries. Immunohistochemical labelling of mammary and cerebral arteries revealed the presence of Cav2.1 in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Cav3.1 was also detected in mammary arteries. Conclusion: P/Q- and T-type Ca-v are present in human internal mammary arteries and in cerebral penetrating arterioles. P/Q- and T-type calcium channels are involved in the contraction of mammary arteries from hypertensive patients but not from normotensive patients. Furthermore, in cerebral arterioles P/Q-type channels importance was restricted to hypertensive patients might lead to that T-and P/Q-type channels could be a new target in hypertensive patients."

Given the high selectivity of this compound at the cannabinoid CB2 receptor and the well-known protective function of this receptor in neurological disorders with autoimmune component like multiple sclerosis, we assessed the immunomodulatory properties of VL15. We assessed on activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells), proliferation and viability, cell cycle progression and measured activation markers and the expression of phosphorylated proteins. We found that VL15 reduces PBMC proliferation slightly affecting cell vitality, blocks the cell cycle progression and down-regulates the levels of T cell activation markers as well as the expression of phosphorylated proteins, NF-kB, IKK alpha beta, IKB alpha, ERK and Akt. VL15 was also used in drug permeability assays on Caco-2 cell line to evaluate its oral bioavailability and on MDCKII-hMDR1 cell lines to estimate its propensity to cross the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion, in order to potentially maintain its efficiency on the infiltrating auto-reactive lymphocytes in the central nervous system. In these models, VL15 showed high intestinal absorption and good blood-brain barrier penetration. Our findings suggest that VL15, by controlling the immune response, might find potential application as orally administered drug in pathologies like multiple sclerosis.

1147,Medical , Multiple Sclerosis  , Doppler ultrasound; four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging; multiple sclerosis; venous blood flow; venous luminography        ,"A possibly causal relationship between multiple sclerosis and chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency has recently been hypothesized. Studies investigating chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency have reported conflicting results and few have employed multiple diagnostic imaging modalities across a large patient and control population. In this study, three complementary imaging modalities were used to investigate the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency hypothesis in patients with multiple sclerosis and two age- and sex-matched control groups: healthy volunteers and patients with other neurological diseases. Strictly blinded Doppler ultrasound according to the original chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency hypothesis; four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging of venous flow in the head, neck, and chest; and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography for neck and chest venous luminography were acquired. An internal jugular vein stenosis evaluation was also performed across modalities. Percentage of subjects meeting ultrasound-based chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency criteria was small and similar between groups. In group-wise and pairwise testing, no four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging variables were statistically significantly different, for any measurement location. In contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography of the internal jugular and azygos veins, no statistically significant differences were observed in stenosis scores between groups. These results represent compelling evidence against the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency hypothesis in multiple sclerosis."
1659,Medical , Multiple Sclerosis  , relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; resting-state functional connectivity; striatal subregions; dorsal caudal putamen; pathophysiology        ,"Abnormal corticostriatal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) has been implicated in the neuropathology of multiple sclerosis. The striatum, a component of the basal ganglia, is involved in diverse functions including movement, cognition, emotion, and limbic information processing. However, the brain circuits of the striatal subregions contributing to the changes in rsFC in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients remain unknown. We used six subdivisions of the striatum in each hemisphere as seeds to investigate the rsFC of striatal subregions between RRMS patients and matched healthy controls (HCs). In addition, we also scanned a subcohort of RRMS patients after an average of 7 months to test the reliability of our findings. Compared to HCs, we found significantly increased dorsal caudal putamen (DCP) connectivity with the premotor area, dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule, and significantly increased connectivity between the superior ventral striatum and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in RRMS patients following both scans. Furthermore, we found significant associations between the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the rsFC of the left DCP with the DLPFC and parietal areas in RRMS patients. Our results suggest that the DCP may be a critical striatal subregion in the pathophysiology of RRMS."
1774,Medical , Multiple Sclerosis  , 7 Tesla; MRI; Aging; Cerebral cortex; Iron; Phase        ,"Accumulation of brain iron has been suggested as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Increased iron has been seen in the cerebral cortex in postmortem studies of neurodegenerative diseases and healthy aging. Until recently, the diminutive thickness of the cortex and its relatively low iron content have hampered in vivo study of cortical iron accumulation. Using phase images of a T2*-weighted sequence at ultrahigh field strength (7 Tesla), we examined the iron content of 22 cortical regions in 70 healthy subjects aged 22e80 years. The cortex was automatically segmented and parcellated, and phase shift was analyzed using an in-house developed method. We found a significant increase in phase shift with age in 20 of 22 cortical regions, concurrent with current understanding of cortical iron accumulation. Our findings suggest that increased cortical iron content can be assessed in healthy aging in vivo. The high spatial resolution and sensitivity to iron of our method make it a potentially useful tool for studying cortical iron accumulation in healthy aging and neurodegenerative diseases.

1775,Medical , Multiple Sclerosis  , brain; ceramide; lipidomics; mass spectrometry; neurodegeneration        ,"Accumulation of ceramide is implicated in mediating the cellular responses to stress and aberrant sphingolipid metabolism is frequently associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. It is often assumed that (i) peripheral disturbances in sphingolipid concentrations are reflective of processes occurring in the brain, or (ii) circulating sphingolipids directly influence cerebral sphingolipid abundance. In order to address these assumptions, this study explores, in a physiological system, the metabolic pathways regulating sphingolipid metabolism in the brain and plasma of mice. Male C57Bl/6 were maintained on a low fat (control diet) or saturated fat enriched (SFA) diet with, or without the provision of sphingolipid modulating agents. Following 6 months of feeding, the abundance of seven sphingolipid classes was assessed by LC-ESI-MS/MS in the hippocampus (HPF), cerebral cortex (CTX), and plasma. Long-term consumption of the SFA diet increased ceramide and dihydroceramide in the plasma. Inhibiting de novo synthesis ameliorated this effect, while inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase, or the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist did not. SFA feeding did not influence sphingolipid levels in either the HPF or CTX. De novo synthesis inhibition reduced ceramide in the CTX, while treatment with a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor agonist reduced ceramides in the HPF. Analysis of the individual ceramide species revealed the effects were chain-length dependent. Both positive and negative correlations were observed between plasma and HPF/CTX ceramide species. The findings in this study show that HPF and CTX sphingolipid concentration are influenced by distinct pathways, independent of peripheral sphingolipid concentration."

The dog's CBC displayed a moderate to severe macrocytic, hypochromic, nonregenerative anemia, and a moderate leukopenia as result of a moderate neutropenia and monocytopenia. Microscopic examination of the blood smear showed marked anisocytosis, mild polychromasia, mild acanthocytosis and ovalocytosis, moderate schistocytosis and poikilocytosis, and 4 metarubricytes/100 WBC. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a homogenous, mild to moderately hyperechoic appearing liver as well as marked amounts of speckled anechoic to slightly hypoechoic peritoneal fluid. Cytology of the ascitic fluid demonstrated a sterile transudate, with evidence of a chronic inflammatory reaction as well as erythroid and myeloid precursor cells, and a few megakaryocytes with occasional micromegakaryocytes. Histologic sections of bone marrow, spleen, and liver were examined, using routine H&E stains, as well as a variety of immunohistochemistry and other special stains. Histopathology of the bone marrow and spleen revealed varying degrees of fibrosis, erythroid, and myeloid hyperplasia, as well as multiple small hyperplastic clusters of megakaryocytes. The megakaryocytes displayed many features of atypia such as increased cytoplasmic basophilia and occasional abnormal chromatin clumping with mitoses. Histopathologic examination of the liver disclosed evidence of mild extramedullary hematopoiesis. This case represents the first report of canine idiopathic myelofibrosis associated with peritoneal extramedullary hematopoiesis, resulting in refractory ascites. Although idiopathic myelofibrosis is a relatively rare condition in dogs, this case demonstrates that ascites caused by peritoneal implants of hematopoietic tissue may be the initial manifestation of myelofibrosis."

We reevaluated the diagnostic interest of measuring circulating CD34+ cells in 26 healthy volunteers and 256 consecutive patients at diagnosis for whom a myeloproliferative neoplasm was suspected. The ROC curve analysis showed that a number of CD34+ < 10/mu l excludes the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 90%(area under the curve: 0.93 [0.89-0.98]; p < 0.001). Patients with PMF harboring a CALR mutation had more circulating CD34+ cells than patients with either a JAK 2 or MPL mutation (p = 0.02 and p < 0.01, respectively). These results suggest that this fast, simple, non-invasive, and standardized test is of particular interest to exclude the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis."

Ruxolitinib was given twice a day (bid) at a starting dose of 15 mg (n = 25) or 20 mg (n = 38) based on a baseline platelet count. About 94.7% of the patients achieved a reduction in spleen size, 27.0% of which exhibited significant reduction (>= 35%) at week 24. Significant improvement in debilitating constitutional symptoms, as assessed by MFSAF v2.0, was observed in patients treated with ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib treatment was generally well tolerated by Chinese patients. Although the treatment was associated with an increase in certain adverse events (AEs) that were established as identified risks (anemia and thrombocytopenia), these AEs were considered manageable in this clinical setting. Ruxolitinib provided substantial reductions in splenomegaly and improvements in symptoms, and was well-tolerated by Chinese patients with MF."

We analyzed beta-catenin mRNA expression in bone marrow of 29 patients with primary (PMF), 4 with secondary (SMF) myelofibrosis, and 16 control participants using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). beta-Catenin expression is increased in PMF and SMF and might potentiate anemia. Introduction: beta-Catenin is a central effector molecule of the canonical wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling pathway. It is important for maintenance of stem cell homeostasis and its aberrant activation has been implicated in a wide array of malignant hematological disorders. There are few reports suggesting its dysregulation in Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Patients and Methods: We analyzed beta-catenin mRNA expression in bone marrow (BM) aspirates of 29 patients with primary (PMF) and 4 patients with secondary, post Ph- MPN, myelofibrosis (SMF) using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT PCR). The control group consisted of 16 BM aspirates from patients with limited-stage aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma without BM involvement. We compared relative gene expression with clinical and hematological parameters. Results: Relative expression of A-catenin differed significantly among groups (P = .0002), it was significantly higher in patients with PMF and SMF than in the control group, but did not differ between patients with PMF and SMF. A negative correlation was found regarding hemoglobin level in PMF (P = .017). No association according to Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutational status or JAK2 V617F allele burden was detected. Conclusion: Our results show for the first time that beta-catenin mRNA expression is increased in patients with PMF and SMF and its upregulation might potentiate anemia. A number of inflammatory cytokines associated with PMF are capable of mediating their effects through increased beta-catenin expression. Accordingly, beta-catenin can induce expression of a number of genes implicated in processes of cell cycle control, fibrosis, and angiogenesis, which are central to the PMF pathogenesis. Therefore, beta-catenin might represent an interesting new therapeutic target in these diseases."
2289,Medical , Myelofibrosis  , All cerebrovascular disease/Stroke; Risk factors in epidemiology; Clinical trials observational study (cohort    case control); JAK2 V617F mutation; Myeloproliferative neoplasm       ,"Aim. - To determine the incidence and main characteristics of cerebrovascular events as the presenting manifestations of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Methods. - The Hematology in Lyon (HEMILY) registry is a prospective database (763 patients) of all cases of MPN diagnosed since 2005 in the Rhone-Alpes district of France. The MPN cases were divided into four groups: polycythemia vera (PV); essential thrombocythemia (ET); myelofibrosis (MF); and atypical MPN. The ischemic stroke subtype was classified according to TOAST criteria. Results. - A stroke history revealed MPN in 35 (4.3%) patients: 22 (63%) had an ischemic stroke; eight (23%) had a transient ischemic attack; four (11%) had cerebral venous thrombosis; and one (3%) had hemorrhagic stroke. All patients had hemoglobin and/or platelet count abnormalities. In addition, 12 (34%) patients had PV, 21 (60%) had ET, one (3%) had MF and one (3%) had atypical/unclassified MPN. The JAK2 V617F mutation was found in 83% of patients. In 18 (51%) patients, an additional mechanism of stroke was present (atherosclerosis in 10 patients, atrial fibrillation in one patient and dissection in another). The median NIHSS score at entry was 2, and the median modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months was 0. Compared with the general MPN population, stroke-MPN patients presented with significantly higher levels of hemoglobin (P < 0.001) and were more frequently positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation (P = 0.044). Conclusion. - Stroke revealing MPN is rare. However, careful attention should still be paid to blood counts even in patients with obvious stroke etiologies, as early diagnosis permits prompt treatment and decreases the risk of recurrence, thus limiting morbidity and mortality.

To relate the diagnostic performance of [F-18]fluorocholine positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) to the phospholipid composition of liver tumors, radiopathologic correspondence was performed in patients with early-stage liver cancer who had undergone [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT before tumor resection. Tumor and adjacent liver were profiled by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, quantifying phosphatidylcholine species by mass-to-charge ratio. For clinical-radiopathologic correlation, HCC profiles were reduced to two orthogonal principal component factors (PCF1 and PCF2) accounting for 80 % of total profile variation. Tissues from 31 HCC patients and 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients were analyzed, revealing significantly higher levels of phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and highly saturated phosphatidylcholine species in HCC tumors relative to adjacent liver and ICC tumors. Significant loading values for PCF1 corresponded to phosphatidylcholines containing poly-unsaturated fatty acids while PCF2 corresponded only to highly saturated phosphatidylcholines. Only PCF2 correlated significantly with HCC tumor-to-liver [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio (rho = 0.59, p < 0.0005). Sensitivity for all tumors based on an abnormal [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio was 93 % while sensitivity for HCC based on increased tumor [F-18]fluorocholine uptake was 84 %, with lower levels of highly saturated phosphatidylcholines in tumors showing low [F-18]fluorocholine uptake. Most HCC tumors contain high levels of saturated phosphatidylcholines, supporting their dependence on de novo fatty acid metabolism for phospholipid membrane synthesis. While [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT can serve to identify these lipogenic tumors, its imperfect diagnostic sensitivity implies metabolic heterogeneity across HCC and a weaker lipogenic phenotype in some tumors."
310,Medical , Cancer  , Mechanobiology; In vitro invasiveness; Metastatic potential; Cell-substrate mechanical interactions; Breast cancer        ,"A critical step in metastases formation is cancer-cell invasion through tissue. During invasion, cells change morphology and apply forces to their surroundings. We have previously shown that single, metastatic breast-cancer cells will mechanically indent a synthetic, impenetrable polyacrylamide gel with physiological-stiffness in attempted invasion; benign breast cells do not indent the gels. In solid tumors, e.g., breast cancers, metastases occur predominantly by collective cell-invasion. Thus, here we evaluate the effects of cell proximity on mechanical invasiveness, specifically through changes in gel indention. Gel indentation is induced by 56, 33 and 2% (in >1000 cells), respectively, of adjacent high metastatic potential (MP), low MP and benign breast cells, being double the amounts observed in single, well-separated cells. Single cells exhibited a distribution of indentation depths below 10 A mu m, while adjacent cells also showed a second peak of deeper indentations. The second peak included 65% of indenting high MP cells as compared to 15% in the low MP cells, illustrating the difference in their invasiveness. Thus, proximity of the metastatic cells enhances their mechanical ability to invade, demonstrating why collective cancer-cell migration is likely more efficient. This could potentially provide a rapid, quantitative approach to identify metastatic cells, and to determine their metastatic potential."

561,Medical , Cancer  , Microfluidics; Personalized medicine        ,"A high-throughput, microfluidic flow cell array (MFCA) system has been modified to enable drug screening against small-volume cell-, and tissue cultures. The MFCA is composed of a 3D channel network that simultaneously flows fluids through forty-eight 830 mu m by 500 mu m flow cells, which physically divide and fluidically seal an existing culture into multiple compartments when docked onto the surface of a cell or tissue culture dish. The modified system provides temperature (37 degrees C) and CO2/pH level controls, while continuously flowing solutions (media or other liquid such as drug suspensions) over the cells/tissues. These assays were enhanced and validated using inverted microscopy and fluorescent staining techniques which also allow real time viability and toxicity assessments. This work presents the results of this new generation in vitro drug testing assay performed using this modified MFCA system. This setup allows the testing of 48 drug combinations on 48 different cell-, tissue specimen at once under flow conditions. All 48 flow cells were utilized to test 5 different concentrations of cisplatin (CDDP). CDDP solutions in various concentrations were continually flowed over cultured human ovarian cancer cells for 48 h. Viability assessments were performed using red-orange calcein and SYTOX (R) Green nucleic acid stains. Cells were imaged at the beginning and end of the experiment (48 h). In order to compare and validate MFCAs suitability as drug screening assay, MTT assays were performed on cells. We found that both, MTT and MFCA assays generated dose-response curves with similar profiles. Innovative advantages of the MFCA system include the ability of handling smaller amounts of solutions compared to conventional and current state of the art drug screening and cell viability/toxicity methods. It also provides the ability to continually deliver fresh solution to the cell samples, while eliminating wastes that are produced. Based on our here reported findings MFCA may have a strong potential of providing a more physiological model than current state of the art static MTT assays."

The resultant CPD NPs are of homogeneous spherical structure with sizes from 69 +/- 11 to 107 +/- 18 nm. Doxorubicin (DOX) was then loaded into the CPD NPs in high efficiency, and showing typical reduction and pH dual responsive release profiles. The flow cytometric analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) confirmed that the DOX-loaded CPD NPs could be internalized into cancer cell efficiently and release DOX in intracellular environment. Furthermore, cell cytotoxicity assays indicated that the CPD NPs had good biocompatibility toward both cancerous and normal cells, while the Dox-loaded CPD NPs exhibited significant inhibition of cell proliferation in various cancer cells. Therefore, this biocompatible CPD NP may have great potential for intracellular drug delivery in clinical cancer therapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The purpose of this cross-sectional observer study was to investigate (1) the inter- and intraobserver agreement of evaluating pisotriquetral OA using pisotriquetral views with a special focus on sclerosis, joint space width (JSW) narrowing and osteophyte formation, and (2) the incidence of these latter radiographic features in patients suspected for pisotriquetral OA. Five independent observers rated independently at two different occasions 27 pisotriquetral views from patients treated for ulnar-sided wrist pain suspected for pisotriquetral OA requiring a pisiform resection. The agreement was calculated using kappa statistic. Agreement between observers ranged from 0.38 (fair) to 0.56 (moderate). Average intraobserver agreement ranged from 0.43 (moderate) to 0.52 (moderate). In 36% of the ratings, JSW narrowing was observed, followed by osteophyte formation (30%) and sclerosis (28%). Observers found it especially difficult to detect JSW narrowing. Despite the availability of a pisotriquetral view to enhance visualization of the pisotriquetral joint, assessment of the specific features indicating pisotriquetral OA leads to only fair-to-moderate agreement. This limits the applicability of a radiographic assessment. A rationale for a more reliable radiologic approach in assessing the level of pisotriquetral OA is needed, which may require the use of more advanced imaging techniques."

Yet, this association may be confounded by facet joint osteoarthritis. BMD may not be a risk factor for lumbar disc degeneration in Chinese. Purpose Evidence suggested that lumbar vertebral bone and intervertebral disc interact with each other in multiple ways. The current paper aims to determine the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and lumbar disc degeneration using a sample of Chinese. Methods We studied 165 patients with back disorders and 347 general subjects from China. All subjects had lumbar spine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) spine BMD studies, and a subset of general subjects had additional hip BMD measurements. On T2-weighted MR images, Pfirrmann score was used to evaluate the degree of lumbar disc degeneration and facet joint osteoarthritis was assessed as none, slight-moderate, and severe. Regression analyses were used to examine the associations between lumbar and hip BMD and disc degeneration, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), lumbar region, and facet joint osteoarthritis. Results Greater facet joint osteoarthritis was associated with greater spine BMD (P0.05), and between hip BMD and disc degeneration in general subjects (P >0.05). Conclusion BMD may not be a risk factor for lumbar disc degeneration in Chinese. Facet joint osteoarthritis inflates DXA spine BMD measurements and therefore, may confound the association between spine BMD and disc degeneration."

Vertebral body fracture was more frequent in the atrophic type, suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis at the onset of hip osteoarthritis. Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with increased bone formation at a local site. However, excessive bone resorption has also been found to occur in the early stages of OA. Osteoporosis may be involved in the onset of OA in elderly patients. We conducted a cross-sectional radiographic study of patients with hip OA and examined the association between age and factors of acetabular dysplasia (Sharp's angle, acetabular roof obliquity angle, and acetabular head index) as well as the osteoblastic response to determine the potential involvement of osteoporosis. Methods This study included 366 patients (58 men, 308 women) who had undergone total hip arthroplasty for the diagnosis of hip OA. We measured the parameters of acetabular dysplasia using preoperative frontal X-ray images and evaluated each patient according to Bombelli classification of OA (hypertrophic, normotrophic, or atrophic type). Results As the patients aged, the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased. The incidence of the atrophic type of OA was significantly higher in older patients. Vertebral body fractures were more frequent in the atrophic type than in the other types. Additionally, the index of acetabular dysplasia was lower in the atrophic type. By contrast, the hypertrophic type was present in relatively younger patients and was associated with an increased index of acetabular dysplasia. Conclusion In elderly patients with hip OA, the parameters of acetabular dysplasia decreased and the incidence of the atrophic type increased as the patients aged. The frequency of vertebral body fracture was high in patients with the atrophic type, suggesting the involvement of osteoporosis in the onset of hip OA."

It shows poor water solubility and short half-life (4 hours). To improve its bioavailability aceclofenac hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) complex was prepared and then characterized for improving the solubility, dissolution and overall improvement in analgesic and anti inflammatory activity. The aceclofenac was complexed with HP-beta-CD by kneading method and then its 3 fractions were coated with PVP for different time. The proper mixture of dispersion was used for the potential therapeutic activity. The prepared aceclofenac HP-beta-CD complex showed more than 4 fold improvement in solubility (0.41 +/- 0.06 mg/mL of aceclofenacHP-beta-CD complex against 0.10 +/- 0.01 mg/mL of pure drug). The FTIR and XRPD confirmed the complex formation and amorphization of drug, respectively. The aceclofenac: HP-beta-CD inclusion complex showed better dissolution profile than pure drug aceclofenac. The pure drug aceclofenac showed a drug release of 28.02% at the end of 12 h. On the other hand the aceclofenac HP-beta-CD complex showed 89.29% drug release after 12 h. The cyclodextrin complex showed 59.34% analgesia as compared to the 56.04% analgesia shown by the standard oral tablet formulation. The anti inflammatory activity was 90.09 +/- 1.02 and 92.22 +/- 1.05% in terms of % inhibition of rat paw edema at the end of 24 h for standard and test, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the aceclofenac HP-beta-CD complex may serve as the prolonged drug delivery system along with PVP coating for the effective management of orthopedic pain and inflammation."

In addition to abnormal anatomy, changes in kinematics, joint reaction forces (JRFs), and muscle forces could cause tissue damage to the cartilage and labrum, and may contribute to pain and fatigue. The objective of this study was to compare lower extremity joint angles, moments, hip JRFs and muscle forces during gait between patients with symptomatic acetabular dysplasia and healthy controls. Marker trajectories and ground reaction forces were measured in 10 dysplasia patients and 10 typically developing control subjects. A musculoskeletal model was scaled in OpenSim to each subject and subject-specific hip joint centers were determined using reconstructions from CT images. Joint kinematics and moments were calculated using inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics, respectively. Muscle forces and hip JRFs were estimated with static optimization. Inter-group differences were tested for statistical significance (p= 0.8). Results demonstrated that dysplasia patients had higher medially directed JRFs. Joint angles and moments were mostly similar between the groups, but large inter-group effect sizes suggested some restriction in range of motion by patients at the hip and ankle. Higher medially-directed JRFs and inter-group differences in hip muscle forces likely stem from lateralization of the hip joint center in dysplastic patients. Joint force differences, combined with reductions in range of motion at the hip and ankle may also indicate compensatory strategies by patients with dysplasia to maintain joint stability.

The students were subjected to a questionnaire designed to approach four health related topics including nutrition literacy, health awareness, nutritional habits and health related performance. Answers on each topic were collected and statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software including a measure of gender differences and correlative studies. No significant difference between genders in the overall responses but discrepancies in certain questions were observed. Female students showed higher awareness of nutrition concepts and practices but poor implementation from their side was observed. The study revealed that a positive and significant correlation existed between health related performance and nutrition literacy (r = 0.32). Healthier eating habits and lifestyle were associated more with nutrition conscious students (r = 0.73) than knowledgeable students (r = 0.56). It was concluded that knowledge alone is not enough to stimulate individuals to practice healthy habits. Other implementations are required to raise awareness of the issues at hand."

Muscle and coordination training are recommended to the patients as general measures. We inquired whether sling training is better than traditional physiotherapy in relieving pain and improving abilities of daily living. Fifty patients with osteoporosis were divided into two groups. Group A performed conventional physiotherapy, while Group B performed sling training exercises. Data were collected before and after the intervention and after 3 months. The registered parameters were stamina, posture, and pain. Posture, torques, and the associated strength of spinal muscles were studied in a biomechanical model in order to estimate the forces acting on the spine. Furthermore, the factors that exerted a positive impact on the success of therapy were registered. Forty-four patients (88%) completed the study. Positive effects of the training were noted in both groups, but significantly better effects were observed in the group that performed sling training. A reduction of pain independent of the number of fractures, significantly reduced torques, and reduced muscle strength were registered. Specific training programs helped to increase muscle strength and straightening the back thereby reducing the force needed on a permanent basis and decreasing torque in the spine.

New evidence indicates that factors related to sex influence the fetal development of the axial skeleton. Girls are born with smaller vertebral cross-sectional area compared to boys-a sexual dimorphism that is present throughout life and independent of body size. The smaller female vertebra is associated with greater flexibility of the spine that could represent the human adaptation to fetal load. It also likely contributes to the higher prevalence of spinal deformities, such as exaggerated lordosis and progressive scoliosis in adolescent girls when compared to boys, and to the greater susceptibility for spinal osteoporosis and vertebral fractures in elderly women than men."

In the experiment, rhein anchored on magnetic chitosan microparticles, prepared facilely without removal of the template molecule, was used as sorbents for the extraction of target analytes; after completion of the extraction process, Fe3O4 particles acted as carrier to retrieve rhein functionalized magnetic chitosan microparticles (RMCMPs) from the sample solution. RMCMPs showed excellent selective adsorption capacity of isoflavones. The result suggested that the method was useful for fast determination and quantification of isoflavones in soymilk. The RMCMPs were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transforms infrared spectrometer (FTIR). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Among them, the most potent compound, 37 (QG368), showed 72.3% inhibition even at a low concentration of 0.1 mu M, which was about 188-fold more potent than the lead compound. Cytotoxicity test on BMMs indicated that the inhibition on osteoclast differentiation of 37 did not result from its cytotoxicity. Moreover, 37 also showed no obvious effect on osteoblast differentiation. Mechanistic studies disclosed that 37 can inhibit the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes, including Nfatcl, TRAP, cathepsin K, C-src and CTR. In particular, 37 could decrease the ovariectomy-induced osteoclast activity and relieve the osteoporosis obviously in vivo. Therefore, these tricyclic diterpene analogs could be served as promising leads for the development of a new class of antiresorptive agents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved."
141,Medical , Overactive Bladder  , Urinary incontinence; Polyuria; Polydipsia; Arginine vasopressin        ,"A 4-year-old boy was referred to the nephrologist with daytime urinary incontinence and suspicion of an overactive bladder. At the age of 17 months he had been referred to the pediatric endocrinologist because of polyuria and polydipsia in order to exclude diabetes insipidus. Repeated water deprivation tests and a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain were normal. Diabetes insipidus was excluded, and primary polydipsia was thought to be most likely since diabetes mellitus also had been excluded. At the current presentation, he drank up to 3 L a day and quite often had wet diapers. He also seemed to pass stools infrequently and with difficulty. Curiously his grandmother had similar symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia since childhood and had been diagnosed with primary polydipsia. The physical examination of our pediatric patient was normal. In the differential diagnosis we included diabetes insipidus but also contemplated other possibilities, such as nephronophthisis, tubulopathies and hypercalciuria. Laboratory results including urinalysis and an ultrasound of the kidney did not show any abnormalities, making a tubulopathy or hypercalciuria unlikely. A desmopressin test by the intravenous route came back completely normal, pointing to another cause than diabetes insipidus. Genetic testing for the nephronophthisis came back negative but was positive for a missense mutation in the AVPR2 gene (p.Arg104Cys) associated with partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. He was started on daily desmopressin. Within 3 days the urinary incontinence resolved as did the polyuria and faecal incontinence. His grandmother was referred to the geneticist and eventually the adult nephrologist. This case highlights the importance of being thorough when confronted with a difficult diagnosis. It also emphasizes that a test result does not necessarily equate to the presence or absence of a condition since the test with 100 % sensitivity and specificity has yet to be discovered."

1200,Medical , Overactive Bladder  , Psychotropic drugs; Lower urinary tract symptoms; Urinary retention; Urinary incontinence; Antipsychotic agents; Antidepressive agents        ,"A psychotropic drug is defined as a drug ""capable of affecting the mind, emotions, and behavior; denoting drugs used in the treatment of mental illnesses"" (Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing 2012). Use of these drugs can lead to urinary dysfunction, but it is often difficult to delineate whether urinary dysfunction is a direct/indirect result of drug use or secondary to an unrelated concurrent condition. This situation can therefore result in diagnostic or management dilemmas for urologists, psychiatrists, and primary care physicians. This article reviews the literature published in the last 3 years, and provides an update on the desirable and undesirable effects of psychotropic drugs on lower urinary function. Duloxetine is an antidepressant with efficacy in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. In addition, duloxetine and desipramine have been proposed in the treatment of overactive bladder. Laboratory research into potential therapies which target the role of neurotrophins in lower urinary tract function is in progress. Narcotic analgesia, several antipsychotics, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, and stimulant medications are associated with urinary retention. Several antidepressants have been associated with nocturnal enuresis. Furthermore, ketamine is known to induce storage symptoms, with reduction in bladder capacity. Lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS)-causing drugs are associated with polypharmacy, and elderly patients are particularly susceptible to adverse events due to pharmacotherapy. Awareness of psychotropic drug side effects and rationalization of their use is important to avoid undesirable outcomes. When patients with bothersome LUTS who are on psychotropic drugs fail to benefit from simple first-line treatments for LUTS, clinicians should be mindful that the psychotropic drug may indeed be the cause of LUTS and seek to liaise with the patient's psychiatrist or primary care physician to discuss reasonable alternatives."
2096,Medical , Overactive Bladder  , Micturition; Central nervous control; Visceral pain; Bladder        ,"Afferent input from A delta and C-fibres innervating the urinary bladder are processed differently by the brain, and have different roles in signaling bladder sensation. A delta fibres that signal bladder filling activate a spino-bulbo-spinal loop, which relays in the midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG) and pontine micturition centre (PMC). The excitability of this circuitry is regulated by tonic GABAergic inhibitory processes. In humans and socialised animals micturition is normally under volitional control and influenced by a host of psychosocial factors. Higher nervous decision-making in a social context to 'go now' or 'do not go' probably resides in frontal cortical areas, which act as a central control switch for micturition. Exposure to psychosocial stress can have profoundly disruptive influence on the process and lead to maladaptive changes in the bladder. During sleeping the voiding reflex threshold appears to be reset to a higher level to promote urinary continence. Under physiological conditions C-fibre bladder afferents are normally silent but are activated in inflammatory bladder states and by intense distending pressure. Following prolonged stimulation visceral nociceptors sensitise, leading to a lowered threshold and heightened sensitivity. In addition, sensitization may occur within the central pain processing circuitry, which outlasts the original nociceptive insult. Visceral nociception may also be influenced by genetic and environmental influences. A period of chronic stress can produce increased sensitivity to visceral pain that lasts for months. Adverse early life events can produce even longer lasting epigenetic changes, which increase the individual's susceptibility to developing visceral pain states in adulthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

2328,Medical , Overactive Bladder  , Mouse; Immunohistochemistry; Afferent nerves        ,"Aim: Increased afferent fibre activity contributes to pathological conditions such as the overactive bladder syndrome. Nerve fibres running near the urothelium are considered to be afferent as no efferent system has yet been described. The aim of this study was to identify sub-types of afferent nerve fibres in the mouse bladder wall based on morphological criteria and analyse regional differences. Materials and methods: 27 bladders of six month old C57BL/6 mice were removed and tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry. Cryostat sections were cut and stained for Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP), calcitonin gene related polypeptide (CGRP), neurofilament (NF), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Results: In the sub-urothelium, different types of afferent nerve fibre were found, i.e. immunoreactive (IR) to; CGRP, NF, VAChT, and/or nNOS. At the bladder base, the sub-urothelium was more densely innervated by CGRP-IR and VAChT-IR nerve fibres, then at the lateral wall. NF- and nNOS nerves were sparsely distributed in the sub-urothelium throughout the bladder. At the lateral wall the inner muscle is densely innervated by CGRP-IR nerve fibres. NF, VAChT and nNOS nerves were evenly distributed in the different muscle layers throughout the bladder. Nerve fibre terminals expressing CGRP and NF were found within the extra-mural ganglia at the bladder base. Conclusions: Different types of afferent nerve fibres were identified in the sub-urothelium of the mouse bladder. At the bladder base the sub-urothelium is more densely innervated than the lateral wall by CGRP-IR and VAChT-IR afferent nerve fibres. CGRP and NF afferent nerve fibres in the muscle layer probably relay afferent input to external ganglia located near the bladder base. The identification of different afferent nerves in the sub-urothelium suggests a functional heterogeneity of the afferent nerve fibres in the urinary bladder. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicated that food selectivity was both the most frequently reported type of challenging feeding behavior and the most often reported as problematic but was also the only type of challenging feeding behavior that was not associated with parenting stress. Greater parenting stress was reported when co-parenting agreement and support were lower. Child disruptive behavior at mealtime was the only feeding challenge associated with quality of co-parenting. This paper points to the importance of addressing feeding challenges in addition to selectivity, such as disruptive mealtime behaviors, and doing so within the context of the family and home environment."

This work examines whether daycare center attendance may moderate the relationships between a mother authoritarian style and physical aggression. The study sample was 72 (40 girls) kindergarten children from Spain. Parents were asked to complete two questionnaires focused on individual family characteristics and parenting styles. At age 5, children physical aggression was assessed by direct observation at playtime; aggression scores at 6 was obtained by a peer-rated questionnaire. A least squared multiple regression was performed after controlling for children's level of physical aggression at 5, child sex and siblings. A positive contribution of maternal authoritarian style on physical aggression was detected. Daycare center attendance appears to attenuate the effect of the mother's authoritarian style on physical aggression, only in boys."

PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched in April, 2011 (for all publications prior to that date) and again in August, 2015 (for publications from April, 2011 to August, 2015) using specific keywords and inclusion criteria. A hand search was also conducted. Overall, 107 studies met inclusion criteria for final data extraction and included evaluations of interventions targeted at substance use, early/risky sexual activity and behavioural problems. Eighteen of the 107 studies described programmes targeting parents of adolescents from diverse ethnocultural communities; the quality of these 18 studies was assessed using a marginally modified version of the Downs and Black Checklist (Downs & Black 1998). Their average quality assessment score was 16 out of 28. In addition, two key themes reflected in successful interventions emerged: strengthening parent-adolescent relationship through communication, and importance of community engagement in designing and implementing the intervention. Findings indicate gaps in service delivery to parents of adolescents from ethnoculturally diverse communities; there are a limited number of studies on programmes targeting ethnoculturally diverse parents of adolescents, and the quality of studies that do exist is overall low. Given increasing diversity, more emphasis should be placed on developing and modifying programmes to meet the needs of ethnoculturally diverse communities. More rigorous, standardised efforts should be made to evaluate programmes that do exist."
1467,Medical , Parenting  , Social work; at-risk families; psychosocial risk; social support; social support network; parenting stress        ,"A Summary: Families that are at psychosocial risk live under personal and contextual circumstances that hinder their parenting skills. They frequently lack the resources necessary for addressing the challenges of parenting and encounter multiple stressful life events. Social support may help diminish the parenting stress that is experienced from living in a disadvantaged environment by enhancing coping strategies. However, previous research examining the associations between parenting stress and social support among at-risk families has been inconclusive. This study analyzed the psychosocial profile of at-risk Portuguese families, the size and composition of their social support networks and the associations between social support and parenting stress. Participants consisted of 167 parents (80% mothers) who received assistance from Child Protection Services. Measures included the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, the Arizona Social Support Interview Schedule and a socio-demographic questionnaire. Findings: Parenting stress levels were extremely high, with 44.51% of parents showing clinically significant levels. Emotional support was the type of support that was most closely related to parental distress, namely the network size available for providing emotional support (r=-.27, p=.000) and satisfaction with the emotional support received (r=-.24, p=.006). Applications: The size of the emotional support network was significantly smaller among parents who reported clinically significant levels of parenting stress. Hence, having the opportunity to express feelings and concerns as well as engaging in social interactions during leisure time may serve as protective factors against parental stress in at-risk families. Implications of for the interventions of professionals who work with at-risk families are discussed."

In the context of youth obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and anxiety, accommodation may contribute to the development and maintenance of the disorder. We review the theory and research literature on accommodation, including measures of accommodation. Findings support the idea that accommodation is not a preferred parenting strategy; the sequelae of accommodation are negative and are often associated with both parent and sibling distress. Accommodation should be assessed and targeted in treatment for youth OCD and anxiety. We conclude by identifying several areas for future research, including the development of interventions that specifically target accommodation, the evaluation of potential family factors implicated in accommodation, and the exploration of the construct of accommodation in other childhood disorders."

However, the development of (L)-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) limits the long-term use of (L)-DOPA for PD patients. Some data have reported that adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) antagonists prevented LID in animal model of PD. However, the mechanism in which adenosine A(2A)R blockade alleviates the symptoms of LID has not been fully clarified. Here, we determined to knock out (KO) the gene of A(2A)R and explored the possible underlying mechanisms implicated in development of LID in a mouse model of PD. A(2A)R gene KO mice were unilaterally injected into the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in order to damage dopamine neurons on one side of the brain. 6-OHDA-lesioned mice were then injected once daily for 21 days with (L)-DOPA. Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were evaluated on days 3, 8, 13, and 18 after (L)-DOPA administration, and real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD67 were performed. We found that A(2A)R gene KO was effective in reducing AIM scores and accompanied with decrease of striatal GAD67, rather than GAD65. These results demonstrated that the possible mechanism involved in alleviation of AIM symptoms by A(2A)R gene KO might be through reducing the expression of striatal GAD67."

However, MIBG has a serious disadvantage in that it demands a long examination time. The objective of this study was to evaluate statistically the usefulness of the heart/ mediastinum ratio (H/M) from the early phase of MIBG for the differential diagnosis of DLB. In total, 113 patients were examined, including 32 non-DLB (19 with Alzheimer's dementia) and 79 DLB patients. The mean early-H/M ratio was 2.83 in the non-DLB group and 1.95 in the DLB group. The mean delayed-H/M ratio was 3.0 in the non-DLB group and 1.76 in the DLB group. With a cutoff point of 2.27 on early images, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 65%, 94%, and 73%, respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.82, indicating moderate accuracy. This analysis indicates that images from the early phase of MIBG alone are sufficient for the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and DLB."
523,Medical , Parkinson's Disease  , Atrazine; Parkinson's Disease; Dopaminergic metabolism pathway; Nuclear receptor related factor 1; Developmental susceptibility        ,"A growing number of reports have demonstrated that the widely-used herbicide Atrazine (ATR) can cause injury to dopamine (DA) neurons, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of lactational ATR exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats on dopaminergic neuron health later in life. Compared with control rats, rats exposed to ATR during a critical period of neural development showed decreased striatal DA content and increased rates of DA turnover. The expression of Monoamine oxidase (MAO), which is associated with DA degradation, was up-regulated, and the expression of Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is associated with DA transport, was down-regulated. The expression of transcription factor Nuclear Receptor Related Factor 1 (Nurr1), which is associated with DA neuron development, was down-regulated. Increased age (6-12 months old) increased the statistical significance of the differences of the above indicators in the ATR-treated rats compared to the control rats (P < 0.05). Taken together, our results indicate that ATR exposure during the critical neural development period causes a down-regulation of Nurr1, which in turn affects Nurr1 target genes, including MAO, VMAT2 and DAT, which are involved in DA degradation and transport. Reduced expression of these genes impairs the capacity for vesicular storage or reuptake of DA, causing decreased levels of striatal DA, which can ultimately lead to DA neuron injury. DA neuron injuries become more severe over time, which suggests that aging can synergistically promote the ATR-associated DA neuron injuries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
1638,Medical , Parkinson's Disease  , Parkinson's disease; Mitochondria; alpha Synuclein; TRPC3; Brain        ,"Aberrant alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) accumulation has been shown to impair mitochondrial function by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels are a diverse group of non-selective Ca2+ channels, among which TRPC3 is the only one that is localized in mitochondria and plays a role in maintaining the normal MMP. This raises a possibility that altered TRPC3 expression may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by alpha-syn accumulation. To demonstrate this possibility, we first examined the expressions of mitochondrial TRPC3 in the brains of aging monkeys and alpha-syn transgenic and wild-type mice. We showed that alpha-syn levels increased in mitochondria in an age-dependent manner that was positively correlated to an elevation of mitochondrial TRPC3. This correlation was more prominent in the striatum than in the cerebellum, possibly due to the greater age-dependent alpha-syn accumulation in the striatum than in the cerebellum. We then used primary neurons overexpressing alpha-syn to investigate the effect of the alpha-syn-induced elevation of mitochondrial TRPC3 on the MMP and apoptotic cell death. We found that neurons with overexpressed alpha-syn had increased mitochondrial TRPC3 and decreased MMP, which were accompanied by increased number of apoptotic neurons. Suppressing TRPC3 expression partially reversed the reduction of MMP and alleviated the apoptotic cell death, indicating that the mitochondrial TRPC3 may play a role in the mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons with alpha-syn accumulation that may occur in not only the aged brain but also the brain with PD."

In multicellular organisms, it plays fundamental roles during fertilization, development and adulthood. The inability of cells to regulate Ca2+ can lead to pathological conditions that ultimately culminate in cell death. One such pathological condition is manifested in Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurological disorder in humans, which is characterized by the aggregation of the protein, alpha-synuclein. This Review discusses current evidence that implicates Ca2+ in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Understanding the mechanisms by which Ca2+ signaling contributes to the progression of this disease will be crucial for the development of effective therapies to combat this devastating neurological condition."

The patient presented with a lifelong history of polycythemia, no increase in white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets, and a negative bone marrow biopsy. Analysis of hemoglobin (Hb) fractions showed an abnormal fast moving Hb component. We aimed to determine if this variant was the cause of polycythemia in this patient. A complete blood count (CBC) was performed by an automated cell counter and Hb fractions were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Standard stability tests and oxygen affinity evaluation were also performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the phenol chloroform method and the entire -globin gene was analyzed by direct sequencing. At the hematological level, no anemia or hemolysis was observed but an abnormal Hb fraction was detected using cation exchange HPLC. Molecular analysis of the -globin gene showed heterozygosity for an AAG>ACG substitution at codon 144, resulting in a LysThr amino acid replacement. We demonstrated that this is a new Hb variant with increased oxygen affinity. Its altered physiology is caused by the reduction of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) effects, due to an amino acid substitution in the central pocket near the C-terminal of the chain. We called this new variant Hb San Cataldo for the native city of proband."

These three Ph-1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms share many pathogenic characteristic such as JAK2 mutations; however, they differ in prognosis, progression to myelofibrosis, and risk of leukemic transformation. There are currently various major points of interest in bone marrow examination in myeloproliferative neoplasms. One is the morphology of megakaryocytes, which are the hallmark of Ph-1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms and play a crucial role in separating the different subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Another is reticulin fibrosis or collagen fibrosis, which may only be detected on a bone marrow biopsy specimen by reticulin and trichrome stains, respectively, and immunohistochemistry and certain molecular techniques may be applied in bone marrow biopsies as supporting evidence of certain features of myeloproliferative neoplasms."

This review focuses on the cytokine receptor that plays a significant role in thrombopoiesis: the receptor for thrombopoietin (TPO-R; also known as MPL). Here, we survey the work to date to understand how this receptor functions at a molecular level throughout its lifecycle, from traffic to the cell surface, dimerization and binding cognate cytokine via its extracellular domain, through to its subsequent activation of associated Janus kinases and initiation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as the regulation of these processes. Atomic level resolution structures of TPO-R have remained elusive. The identification of disease-causing mutations in the receptor has, however, offered some insight into structure and function relationships, as has artificial means of receptor activation, through TPO mimetics, transmembrane-targeting receptor agonists, and engineering in dimerization domains. More recently, a novel activation mechanism was identified whereby mutated forms of calreticulin form complexes with TPO-R via its extracellular N-glycosylated domain. Such complexes traffic pathologically in the cell and persistently activate JAK2, downstream signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), and other pathways. This pathologic TPO-R activation is associated with a large fraction of human myeloproliferative neoplasms."

Though initial therapy with ustekinumab achieved a sustained response in our patient, after a seven months of interruption, retreatment resulted in a slower and poorer response than the initial regimen.

Clinical trials usually exclude patients with preexisting autoimmune diseases, thus experience with PD-1 inhibitor (PD-li) in this patient population is limited. Patients and methods: Metastatic melanoma patients with preexisting autoimmune disorders or previous ipilimumab-triggered immune-related adverse events (irAE) undergoing treatment with PD-li from seven German skin cancer centres were evaluated retrospectively with regard to flare of the preexisting autoimmunity and development of new, not preexisting irAE as well as response to PD-li therapy. Results: In total, 41 patients had either preexisting autoimmunity (n = 19, group A, including two patients with additional ipilimumab-triggered autoimmune colitis) or ipilimumab-triggered irAE (n = 22, group B). At PD-li therapy initiation, six patients in group A and two patients in group B required immunosuppressive therapy. In group A, a flare of preexisting autoimmune disorders was seen in 42% of patients, new irAE in 16%. In group B, 4.5% of patients showed a flare of ipilimumab-triggered irAE and 23% new irAE. All flares of preexisting autoimmune disorders or irAE were managed by immunosuppressive and/or symptomatic therapy and did not require termination of PD-li therapy. tumour responses (32% in group A and 45% in group B) were unrelated to occurrence of autoimmunity. Conclusion: While preexisting autoimmunity commonly showed a flare during PD-li therapy, a flare of ipilimumab-triggered irAE was rare. Response rates were above 30% and unrelated to irAE. PD-li therapy can be considered in patients with autoimmune disorders depending on severity and activity of autoimmunity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Tregs are responsible for the maintenance of self-tolerance, thus inhibiting autoimmunity, whereas pro-inflammatory Th17-cells contribute to the induction and propagation of inflammation. Distortion of the Th17/Treg balance favoring the pro-inflammatory Th17 side is hence suspected to contribute to exacerbation of autoimmune disorders. This review aims to summarize recent data and advances in targeted therapeutic modification of the Th17/Treg-balance, as well as information on the efficacy of candidate therapeutics with respect to the treatment of autoimmune diseases."

The aims of this study were to describe baseline characteristics and evolution of a cohort of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treated with ustekinumab and to compare differences between patients who discontinued treatment and those who maintained. A retrospective multicenter observational study including patients who had received ustekinumab for a minimum of 3 months from 2009 to 2015 was performed. The baseline characteristics of the cohort of patients, the main indication for treatment, number and percentage of patients who maintained and discontinued treatment, reasons for discontinuation and differences between patients who discontinued and maintained ustekinumab were evaluated. Fifty-eight patients were included. The main indication was dermatological (72.4% of cases), and treatment with ustekinumab was maintained in most patients (62.1% of cases) with low discontinuation by side effects and rheumatological lack of efficacy. Discontinuation of ustekinumab was correlated with more number of obese patients, less presence of plaque psoriasis and more number of previous biological therapies. Ustekinumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in the management of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in daily clinical practice in our cohort of patients."

Intestinal inflammation may be involved in spondyloarthropathies and in a subset of patients affected by Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood. We compared the fecal microbiota composition of JIA patients with healthy subjects (HS), evaluating differences in microbial profiles between sub-categories of JIA, such as enthesitis-related arthritis (JIA-ERA), in which inflammation of entheses occurs, and polyarticular JIA, non-enthesitis related arthritis (JIA-nERA). Through taxon-level analysis, we discovered alteration of fecal microbiota components that could be involved in subclinical gut inflammation, and promotion of joint inflammation. We observed abundance in Ruminococcaceae in both JIA categories, reduction in Clostridiaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae in JIA-ERA, and increase in Veillonellaceae in JIA-nERA, respectively, compared with HS. Among the more relevant genera, we found an increase in Clostridium cluster XIVb, involved in colitis and arthritis, in JIA-ERA patients compared with HS, and a trend of decrease in Faecalibacterium, known for anti-inflammatory properties, in JIA-nERA compared with JIA-ERA and HS. Differential abundant taxa identified JIA patients for the HLA-B27 allele, including Bilophila, Clostridium cluster XIVb, Oscillibacter, and Parvimonas. Prediction analysis of metabolic functions showed that JIA-ERA metagenome was differentially enriched in bacterial functions related to cell motility and chemotaxis, suggesting selection of potential virulence traits. We also discovered differential microbial profiles and intra-group variability among active disease and remission, suggesting instability of microbial ecosystem in autoimmune diseases with respect to healthy status. Similarly to other chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, different microbial profiles, as observed among different JIA subgroups compared to HS, and potential functional acquisition related to migration, could promote inflammation and contribute to the disease pathogenesis."
3174,Medical , Psoriatic Arthritis  , anti-TNF-alpha; psoriasis; response        ,"Although the heterogeneity of the therapeutic response to TNF- blockers seems to be mainly due to genetic factors, several studies showed that a range of factors may influence it. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of patients' demographic and clinical characteristics on primary response to an anti-TNF- therapy in psoriatic patients. We retrospectively examined the relationship between various clinical and demographic features and response to treatment with etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab, evaluated as PASI75 and average PASI improvement at weeks 12, 16, and 14, respectively. We analyzed data obtained from 199 patients. A better response to the treatment was significantly associated with male gender (OR=2.59), coexistence of psoriatic arthritis (OR=1.97), and PASI 15 at baseline (OR=0.91). The present study supports that some clinical factors may be potential predictors of response to anti-TNF- agents in psoriatic patients."

Static transverse images of maximal supination, neutral and maximal pronation were examined to assess translation, using a method consistent with the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio. Translation while gripping a 1kg weight in supinated and pronated positions was then compared with non-gripping translation. There was significantly more ulnar radial translation found with pronation than supination, when compared with neutral. Gripping in pronation did not produce statistically significant changes in translation, whereas the changes produced by gripping in supination were significant. Internal consistency was deemed very high and the rheumatoid arthritis subluxation ratio values measured using ultrasound imaging were consistent with previously documented values measured by computerized tomography. This study demonstrated that translational movement of the distal radioulnar joint can be reliably detected in healthy participants using ultrasound imaging. This may reduce dependency on other imaging modalities to diagnose distal radioulnar joint instability. Level of Evidence: 2."

We analyzed the real-life factors influencing the first-line choice or the switching strategy, focusing on the prescription of abatacept (ABA) or tocilizumab (TCZ) compared to TNF alpha inhibitors (TNFi). Patients enrolled in the Lombardy Rheumatology Network (LORHEN) Registry after January 1, 2010, when all considered bDMARD agents were available, were included. The population was divided into ""first-"" and ""second-line"" bDMARD. We included 1910 patients (first line n = 1264, second line n = 646). Age was higher in ABA or TCZ vs TNFi treated patients (p < 0.0001). Positive latent tuberculosis screening was associated with first-line ABA (p = 0.002). Methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy was lower in the TCZ group (p = 0.02). The type (dyslipidemia, hypertension, pulmonary disease) and the number of comorbidities influenced the choice towards ABA (p = 0.01). Multinomial logistic regression demonstrated that a second-line treatment, higher age, dyslipidemia, pulmonary disease, other comorbidities, and extra-articular RA manifestations were associated with ABA compared to TNFi. TCZ was associated with a second-line treatment, higher age, and more severe disease activity. Stopping the first bDMARD due to adverse events (AE) influenced the choice towards ABA. In real life, higher age and comorbidities influence the choice towards ABA and TCZ compared to TNFi. ABA was preferred in case of suspension of previous treatments due to AE. After failing a first-line TNFi, swapping to a different mechanism of action is more common."

Several affinity tags, such as the hexahistidine tag, maltose-binding protein, streptavidin-binding peptide tag, calmodulin-binding peptide, c-Myc tag, glutathione S-transferase and FLAG tag, have been introduced for recombinant protein production. The fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the IgG1 antibody is one of the useful affinity tags that can facilitate detection, purification and localization of proteins and can improve the immunogenicity, modulatory effects, physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of proteins. Fc recombinant forms a group of recombinant proteins called Fc-fusion proteins (FFPs). FFPs are widely used in drug discovery, drug delivery, vaccine design and experimental research on receptor-ligand interactions. These fusion proteins have become successful alternatives to monoclonal antibodies for drug developments. In this review, the physicochemical, biochemical, immunological, pharmaceutical and therapeutic properties of recombinant FFPs were discussed as a new generation of bioengineering strategies."

Patients & methods: DNA methylation was quantified in T-lymphocytes from 46 treatment-naive patients using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Treatment response was determined in 6 months using the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Results: Initial filtering identified 21 cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) that were differentially methylated between responders and nonresponders. After conservative adjustment for multiple testing, six sites remained statistically significant, of which four showed high sensitivity and/or specificity (>= 75%) for response to treatment. Moreover, methylation at two sites in combination was the strongest factor associated with response (80.0% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity, AUC 0.85). Conclusion: DNA methylation at diagnosis is associated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment response in early RA."
2560,Medical , Rheumatoid Arthritis  , Type 1 diabetes mellitus; Polymorphisms; MicroRNA        ,"Aims Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by severe autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. The triggering of autoimmunity against beta-cells is probably caused by a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. Even though much is known about the genetic of T1DM, more information is needed to completely unravel this tangled disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs molecules that negatively regulate gene expression by inducing target mRNA cleavage or by inhibiting protein translation. Abnormal miRNA expressions have been described in autoimmune diseases and T1DM. Polymorphisms in genes codifying miRNAs may alter the expression of the corresponding miRNA and, thus, confer susceptibility for a given disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in genes encoding miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-375 are associated with T1DM. Methods Frequencies of the miRNA-146a rs2910164, miRNA-155 rs767649 and miRNA-375 rs6715345 polymorphisms were analyzed in 490 T1DM patients and in 469 nondiabetic subjects. Results The miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-155 rs767649 polymorphisms were associated with protection for T1DM, and the strongest association was observed for the dominant model [odds ratio (OR) = 0.557 95% CI 0.355-0.874 and OR = 0.508, 95% CI 0.265-0.973, respectively, after adjustment for age, ethnicity, and risk HLA loci]. However, miR-375 rs6715345 frequencies did not differ between cases and controls. Conclusion MiR-146a rs2910164 and miR-155 rs767649 polymorphisms were associated with protection for T1DM."

A total of 49 medical consultants, 50 senior nurses and 53 health managers from two public teaching hospitals in Adelaide, Australia, were invited via a personal letter to complete a questionnaire comprising measures of thinking style (the Rational Experiential Inventory) and cognitive style (two dimensions of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (R)). Managers reported a higher preference for 'rational' reasoning than nurses, whereas medical consultants reported a lower preference for 'experiential' reasoning than both managers and nurses. Cognitive style was largely homogenous. Although generalisation of the findings may be limited due to small sample sizes and the self-selection of participants, an understanding of the thinking styles of senior health professionals will likely inform the design and evaluation of future change strategies."

Determining the degree of interest in health education is important for assessing the impact on the target-population and evaluating the dissemination strategy. In the course 'Successful Aging' groups of alder adults came together to discuss health related issues. The course was given by senior health educators aged 55 years and over from the peer group. To determine interest in the course answer cards were sent with a letter of invitation to all independently living inhabitants aged between 55 an 79 in a Dutch community. The rate of expressed interest in the course was 5.8%. Interest was highest among females in the 55-64 age group, the unmarried and those with low wellbeing. Males in the age group 65-79, females aged 75-79, those with a lower socio-economic status and the inactive were comparatively less interested. Subscription to the course was distinguished from mere interest in the course. From those who expressed interest, more people of low socio-economic status, with a reduced level of wellbeing, many physical limitations and poor self-efficacy actually subscribed. It is concluded that the health education program will be continued and that special attention will be paid to groups that showed lower levels of uptake. Involving intermediates from these groups in the course development is recommended. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd."

Background An acute hospital-based elderly care rehabilitation service evolved over a 9-year period from a traditional consultant/junior doctor configuration to a consultant/advanced nurse practitioner configuration. The review evaluated the advanced nurse practitioner team's role in the clinical setting, and the constraints experienced as a result of the traditions of the hospital organization. Evaluation The review drew its conclusions from opinion data collected from 38 professionals and non-professionals within the rehabilitation service. Key issues The organizational infrastructure and traditions that had an impact on service delivery by the advanced nurse practitioner team. There is a demand for senior management to act on developmental constraints. Conclusions The advanced nurse practitioner-led rehabilitation service was fit for purpose and an emerging model of a non-medical led care. However, important organizational constraints were identified. Implications for nursing management An advanced nurse practitioner team, working in collaboration with medical consultants, was a model for future service redesign in the acute hospital setting. Nevertheless, it presented challenges to senior health-care managers on current organizational infrastructures."

Methods: Descriptive information was obtained from the records and minutes of all relevant committees, interviews with key workers who were involved with the committees, managers and senior health professionals, and from the involvement of the authors throughout the process of the implementation. Results: An implementation steering committee was established to oversee the implementation of the plan. Rather than adopting a uniform approach to assigning responsibility for the implementation of each strategy in the plan or developing specific costs and time frames for each strategy, a more pragmatic, flexible and opportunistic approach was taken. Most of the plan's strategies were implemented over a 7-year time frame using a combination of service reorientation and implementation of new programmes, some of which were funded from sources not anticipated during the development of the plan. Implementation required a dedicated driver, commitment at senior level and participation by many staff at many levels. Outcomes, monitored through data collected at 5-year intervals, revealed positive trends in a number of child and youth health indicators. Conclusions: The successful implementation of the strategic plan required pragmatism, flexibility, opportunism and the commitment and involvement of staff at all organisational levels. It is envisaged that this approach provides a firm base for future evidence-based developments to benefit the health and well-being of children, youth and their families and reduce health inequities."

High-resolution computed tomography showed bilateral uniform ground grass opacity in the lower lung fields, partially resolved by smoking cessation. A tentative diagnosis of desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) was made. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed and pathological analysis showed peribronchiolar fibrosis with intra-alveolar macrophage infiltration. Elemental analysis detected aluminum and iron in the upper lobe and only iron in the lower lobe. Thus, a definitive diagnosis of mixed dust pneumoconiosis with DIP-like reaction was made. DIP-like reaction is known to be a reactive change caused by exposure to tobacco smoke as well as by inhalation of inorganic particles. Obtaining a detailed medical history including occupational and environmental risk factors is important to distinguish cases of DIP-like reaction due to exposure to inorganic particles from the usual cases related to smoking, and thus provide suitable treatment.

Each participant carried a microaethalometer to measure BC concentrations for 24 h while their whereabouts and microenvironments (MEs) were recorded via a time-activity diary (TAD) and follow-up interviews. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to compare average BC levels by potential risk factors including demographic, temporal, residential, and indoor/outdoor/transportation activity variables. The children's average daily exposure was 1.93 g/m(3), with a range of 0.2-85.43 g/m(3) (mean daily individual exposure ranges from 0.54 to 4.80 g/m(3)). Even children attending the same elementary school reported BC exposures which differed by approximately 40%, primarily because of individually distinct time-activity patterns and the MEs with which each child interacted. On weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) (1.86 2.50 g/m(3)) and holidays (Saturdays, Sundays, and vacation) (1.71 2.48 g/m(3)), children were subject to reduced exposures to BC, likely due to decreased surrounding traffic volumes and different time-activity patterns on weekend days compared to on weekdays (from Mondays to Fridays) (1.95 2.44 g/m(3)) or school days (weekdays during the school semesters) (2.05 2.43 mu g/m(3)). Commuting in diesel vehicles (often to private academies) or in the subway, cooking, and environmental tobacco smoke were all found to elevate BC exposure. Likewise, proximity to traffic sources and parental indoor smoking contributed to the enhancement of residential BC concentrations. Our findings suggested a need to emplace proactive measures including diesel fleet regulation and smoking cessation campaigns to protect children from high levels of BC exposure.

The lack of scientific data about e-cigarettes led the experts to set out recommendations, mainly based on clinical practice while waiting for scientific validations. The validated smoking cessation treatments keep the first place in the prevention and the treatment of tobacco-induced damages. The e-cigarette, experimented by a large proportion of smokers, is a safer product than tobacco. The health professional must answer the patients about the e-cigarettes: (1) A smoker who questions about e-cigarettes should receive information. Even if there is a lack of data, e-cigarettes offer much lower risks than tobacco. (2) A dual user is at high risk of returning to exclusive tobacco use; he should also optimize other nicotine intakes by combining nicotine replacement therapy and/or optimizing the nicotine intake through the e-cigarette. (3) A smoker who wish to use the e-cigarette in order to quit with or without associated pharmacological treatment should be accompanied and not discouraged. (4) A vaper who is tired to continuing to vape should be accompanied to quit.

1977,Medical , Smoking Cessation  , Yoga; Substance use; Adolescence; Meditation; Mindfulness; School; Addiction        ,"Adolescence is a key developmental period for preventing substance use initiation, however prevention programs solely providing educational information about the dangers of substance use rarely change adolescent substance use behaviors. Recent research suggests that mind-body practices such as yoga may have beneficial effects on several substance use risk factors, and that these practices may serve as promising interventions for preventing adolescent substance use. The primary aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of yoga for reducing substance use risk factors during early adolescence. Seventh-grade students in a public school were randomly assigned by classroom to receive either a 32-session yoga intervention (n = 117) in place of their regular physical education classes or to continue with physical-education-as-usual (n = 94). Participants (63.2 % female; 53.6 % White) completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessing emotional self-regulation, perceived stress, mood impairment, impulsivity, substance use willingness, and actual substance use. Participants also completed questionnaires at 6-months and 1-year post-intervention. Results revealed that participants in the control condition were significantly more willing to try smoking cigarettes immediately post-intervention than participants in the yoga condition. Immediate pre- to post-intervention differences did not emerge for the remaining outcomes. However, long-term follow-up analyses revealed a pattern of delayed effects in which females in the yoga condition, and males in the control condition, demonstrated improvements in emotional self-control. The findings suggest that school-based yoga may have beneficial effects with regard to preventing males' and females' willingness to smoke cigarettes, as well as improving emotional self-control in females. However additional research is required, particularly with regard to the potential long-term effects of mind-body interventions in school settings. The present study contributes to the literature on adolescence by examining school-based yoga as a novel prevention program for substance use risk factors."

[Subjects] The subjects were 51 athletes from Unicaja athletic club who trained regularly. [Methods] At the end of the preseason and volume periods, athletes were subjected to bipodal and monopodal stabilometry. In addition, all injuries happening in the periods after performing stabilometry (volume and pre-competition periods) were tracked. [Results] Variance analysis of bipodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the preseason period showed that athletes with higher values for the center-of-pressure spread variables suffered injuries during the volume period. The right-leg monopodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the volume period showed that athletes with higher values in the center-of-pressure position variables suffered injuries during the pre-competition period. [Conclusion] Athletes showing the worst values for center-of-pressure spread variables are more prone to sports injuries in the subsequent training period. In monopodal measurements, athletes with poorer mediolateral stability were more prone to injuries in the subsequent training period."

The prevention of injuries has become a priority for coaching staffs. Some authors consider training volume, intensity and frequency as key to the prevention of sports injuries. The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a variety of preventive measures focused on volume, intensity and frequency that were included into the training program of a professional futsal team. The number of injuries sustained was compared against that in the same team in other season. The sample included 12 futsal players. The results obtained show that reducing monthly and total training volume, lowering the number of high-intensity microcycles and decreasing the number of weekly training sessions were effective in reducing injury occurrence in one season as compared to the other season."
1220,Medical , Sports Injuries  , Spinal cord injury; Rehabilitation; Rat; Task-specificity; Reach and grasp; Swimming        ,"A rarely explored subject in animal research is the effect of pre-injury variables on behavioral outcome post-SCI. Low reporting of such variables may underlie some discrepancies in findings between laboratories. Particularly, intensive task-specific training before a SCI might be important, considering that sports injuries are one of the leading causes of SCI. Thus, individuals with SCI often underwent rigorous training before their injuries. In the present study, we asked whether training before SCI on a grasping task or a swimming task would influence motor recovery in rats. Swim pre-training impaired recovery of swimming 2 and 4 weeks post-injury. This result fits with the idea of motor learning interference, which posits that learning something new may disrupt learning of a new task; in this case, learning strategies to compensate for functional loss after SCI. In contrast to swimming, grasp pre-training did not influence grasping ability after SCI at any time point. However, grasp pre-trained rats attempted to grasp more times than untrained rats in the first 4 weeks post-injury. Also, lesion volume of grasp pre-trained rats was greater than that of untrained rats, a finding which may be related to stress or activity. The increased participation in rehabilitative training of the pre-trained rats in the early weeks post-injury may have potentiated spontaneous plasticity in the spinal cord and counteracted the deleterious effect of interference and bigger lesions. Thus, our findings suggest that pre-training plays a significant role in recovery after CNS damage and needs to be carefully controlled for. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The probability of a player being injured over a season ranged from 6% to 90% for rugby union and 68% to 96% for rugby league. The pooled injury incidence estimate for rugby union was 26.7/1000 player-hours for injuries irrespective of need for medical attention or time-loss and 10.3/1000 player-hours for injuries requiring at least 7 days absence from games; equivalent to a 28.4% and 12.1% risk of being injured over a season. Study heterogeneity contributed to a wide variation in injury incidence. Public injury surveillance and prevention systems have been successful in reducing injury rates in other countries. No such system exists in the UK.
10,Medical , Sprains and Strains  , National Electronic Injury Surveillance System; water sports; trauma        ,",Background: The objective was to describe the patterns and mechanisms of water tubing related injuries treated in U.S. emergency departments. Methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was used to examine cases of water tubing related injuries. Sample weights were used to calculate national estimates of water tubing related injuries. Analyses were conducted in 2010. Results: From 1991-2009 an estimated 69,471 injuries were treated in US emergency departments for water tubing related injuries. The annual number of cases increased 250% over the 19-year study period (P<.001). Sprains and strains accounted for the largest portion of injuries (27.2%). The head was the most frequently injured body part (27.5%). Children and adolescents= 20 years, were more likely than individuals 19 years to sustain sprains and strains (OR: 2.11; 95% CI = 1.64-2.71) and were most commonly injured by impact with the water (54.6%). Conclusions: Patterns of water tubing related injuries differ for children and adults. Research is needed to determine how best to reduce these injuries."

His complaints subsided gradually within the first six weeks of conservative treatment. At the end of the third month, he returned to follow-up with posterior ankle pain. Radiological examinations revealed heterotopic ossification adjacent to the posterior inferior tibiofibular ligament and posterior capsule. His complaints disappeared only after local excision of the ossification. Heterotopic ossification may be a cause of persistent pain after ankle ligament injuries."

A rare case of an acute strain of the obturator internus muscle, a deep muscle of the hip joint, is reported, which resolved completely after a period of rest and intense active physical therapy."
795,Medical , Sprains and Strains  , epidemiology; exercise rates; injury incidence; injury risk; postal questionnaires        ,"A national study of exercise related morbidity (ERM) in England and Wales was carried out using a postal questionnaire sent to 28857 adults aged 16-45 years. The questionnaire asked about regular participation in sports or other recreational fitness activities involving physical exercise, and for details of any injuries occurring during a 28 d reference period. A return rate of 68% was achieved. Comparisons with other national data sources indicated that the information obtained was reliable. It is estimated that each year there are 29 million incidents resulting in new or recurrent injuries, however minor, of which 9.8 million (95% confidence interval 8.1 to 11.4 million) result in new 'substantive' injuries which are potentially serious, result in treatment, or in participants being unable to take part in their usual activities. Soccer accounted for more than 25% of ail ERM, but the risk of a substantive injury in rugby was three times that in soccer. Over one third of ERR-I occurred in men aged 16-25 years. The most frequently reported injuries were sprains and strains of the lower limbs. Treatment was sought in approximately 25% of ERM incidents and 7% of all new ERM incidents involved at-tendance at a hospital accident and emergency department. The treatment provider most likely to be consulted was a general practitioner, but physiotherapists and complementary medicine practitioners were also consulted frequently. To maximize the health benefits of exercise, research strategies to reduce the volume and severity of ERM and to identify the most appropriate ways of managing ERM should be set."
1189,Medical , Sprains and Strains  , soccer; injuries; children; epidemiology        ,"A prospective study of soccer injuries, involving 287 male youth players, from the ages of 12-15 was conducted in 24 Greek soccer clubs, during the course of one year. A total of 193 players sustained 209 injuries. The incidence of injuries was 4.0 injuries per 1000 h of soccer time per player, and the most common types of injuries were sprains and strains. Surprisingly, it was found that an increase of injury incidences occurred during practice. Fifty-eight injuries required medical assistance. The majority of injuries (80%) were located in the lower extremities. Collision with other players was the most common activity at the time of injury, accounting for 40% of all injuries. The conclusion of this study and the evidence from other studies suggests that youth soccer is a relatively low risk sport. However, a substantial amount of injuries could be prevented. It is necessary to identify the risk factors, which are associated with these types of injuries ."

However, CBT is associated with significant patient dropout and lacks the means to provide objective data regarding a patient's experience and symptoms between sessions. Emerging wearables and mobile health (mHealth) applications represent an approach that may provide objective data to the patient and provider between CBT sessions. Here, we describe the development of a classifier of real-time physiological stress in a healthy population (n = 35) and apply it in a controlled clinical evaluation for armed forces veterans undergoing CBT for stress and anger management (n = 16). Using cardiovascular and electrodermal inputs from a wearable device, the classifier was able to detect physiological stress in a non-clinical sample with accuracy greater than 90%. In a small clinical sample, patients who used the classifier and an associated mHealth application were less likely to discontinue therapy (p = 0.016, d = 1.34) and significantly improved on measures of stress (p = 0.032, d = 1.61), anxiety (p = 0.050, d = 1.26), and anger (p = 0.046, d = 1.41) compared to controls undergoing CBT alone. Given the large number of individuals that experience mental health disorders and the unmet need for treatment, especially in developing nations, such mHealth approaches have the potential to provide or augment treatment at low cost in the absence of in-person care."
1107,Medical , Stress Management  , Disclosure; Avoidance; Writing; Catharsis; Brooding; Verbal Rumination        ,"A persistent assumption across the psychological literature is that talking and writing about one's stress is inherently more beneficial than avoiding it. This study compared the effects of these stress management strategies on personal and relational health. Two hundred and fifty-one dating individuals focused on a stressor that was a current source of rumination. Writing about one's stressor for 5 consecutive days (without talking about it) decreased anxiety the most. Talking continuously about one's stressor to a dating partner harmed the relationship more than writing about or avoiding it. The effect of talking repeatedly about one's stressor on relationship quality and brooding, however, depended upon the emotional support received from one's dating partner and the ability to reappraise (positively or neutrally) the stressor."
1736,Medical , Stress Management  , Adolescents; aspirations; psychological well-being; self-determination theory        ,"According to self-determination theory, an individual's goal content and the processes involved in goal setting often represent the status of the individual's mental health and well-being. When examining the importance placed on goal setting, an individual's goals and aspirations are often synonymous with mental health and well-being. Aspiring to achieve intrinsic life goals has been associated with greater psychological well-being in literature. This study therefore aimed to establish the relationships between goals and aspirations, mental health behaviour (interpersonal relations, stress management, and spiritual growth), and psychological well-being (measured by positive affect). A sample of 457 secondary school learners in the Overberg Educational District, Western Cape, South Africa, participated in the study. The results suggest a significant positive relationship between placing importance on intrinsic goals and aspirations, and psychological well-being (as indicated by positive affect). However, psychological well-being was not correlated with mental health behaviour. The results of the hierarchical regression analysis suggest that importance placed on intrinsic goals and aspirations predicts psychological well-being and accounts for 8% of the variance. The results highlight the role of intrinsic goals and aspirations in predicting the psychological well-being of adolescents. The findings are supported by the theoretical assumptions of self-determination theory."

There are various traditional stress detection methods are available. Research in area of stress detection has developed many techniques for monitoring the human brain that can be used to study the human behavior. However, there are researches on stress detection methods and not on stress reduction methods in terms of technology. This research proposes a novel method that detects the stress using EEG signals and reduces the stress by introducing the interventions into the system. This research uses the k-means clustering method to measure the perceived stress which divide the subjects into different categories and estimate the stress level. The proposed method is useful in developing products for human stress reduction. The success of implementation and development of this research will expected to help in reducing time consumed and human power in determining best solution for stress management."
1829,Medical , Stress Management  , Acidithiobacillus caldus; comparative genomics; intraspecific diversity; gene turnover; evolutionary adaptation        ,"Acidithiobacillus caldus is an extremely acidophilic sulfur-oxidizer with specialized characteristics, such as tolerance to low pH and heavy metal resistance. To gain novel insights into its genetic complexity, we chosen six A, caldus strains for comparative survey. All strains analyzed in this study differ in geographic origins as well as in ecological preferences. Based on phylogenomic analysis, we clustered the six A, caldus strains isolated from various ecological niches into two groups: group 1 strains with smaller genomes and group 2 strains with larger genomes. We found no obvious intraspecific divergence with respect to predicted genes that are related to central metabolism and stress management strategies between these two groups. Although numerous highly homogeneous genes were observed, high genetic diversity was also detected. Preliminary inspection provided a first glimpse of the potential correlation between intraspecific diversity at the genome level and environmental variation, especially geochemical conditions. Evolutionary genetic analyses further showed evidence that the difference in environmental conditions might be a crucial factor to drive the divergent evolution of A, caldus species. We identified a diverse pool of mobile genetic elements including insertion sequences and genomic islands, which suggests a high frequency of genetic exchange in these harsh habitats. Comprehensive analysis revealed that gene gains and losses were both dominant evolutionary forces that directed the genomic diversification of A, caldus species. For instance, horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication events in group 2 strains might contribute to an increase in microbial DNA content and novel functions. Moreover, genomes undergo extensive changes in group 1 strains such as removal of potential non-functional DNA, which results in the formation of compact and streamlined genomes. Taken together, the findings presented herein show highly frequent gene turnover of A. caldus species that inhabit extremely acidic environments, and shed new light on the contribution of gene turnover to the evolutionary adaptation of acidophiles."

Together with advances in neuroengineering, nanotechnology, molecular biology and material sciences, it is now possible to address fundamental questions in neuroscience in new, more powerful ways. It is now possible to apply these new technologies in ways that range from augmenting and restoring function to neuromodulation modalities that treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent developments in neuromodulation methods offer significant advantages and potential clinical benefits for a variety of disorders. Here we describe the current state of the art in neuromodulation methods, and some advances in brain -machine interfaces, describing the advantages and limitations of the clinical applications of each method. The future applications of these new methods and how they will shape the future of psychiatry and medicine, along with safety and ethical implications, are also discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (hereafter referred to as omacetaxine) is a protein translation inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for adult patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 2. The objective was to investigate the metabolite profile of omacetaxine in plasma, urine and faeces samples collected up to 72h after a single 1.25-mg/m(2) subcutaneous dose of C-14-omacetaxine in cancer patients. 3. High-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS) (high resolution) in combination with off-line radioactivity detection was used for metabolite identification. 4. In total, six metabolites of omacetaxine were detected. The reactions represented were mepesuccinate ester hydrolysis, methyl ester hydrolysis, pyrocatechol conversion from the 1,3-dioxole ring. Unchanged omacetaxine was the most prominent omacetaxine-related compound in plasma. In urine, unchanged omacetaxine was also dominant, together with 4'-DMHHT. In feces very little unchanged omacetaxine was found and the pyrocatechol metabolite of omacetaxine, M534 and 4'-desmethyl homoharringtonine (4'-DMHHT) was the most abundant metabolites. 5. Omacetaxine was extensively metabolized, with subsequent renal and hepatic elimination of the metabolites. The low levels of the metabolites found in plasma indicate that the metabolites are unlikely to contribute materially to the efficacy and/or toxicity of omacetaxine."

The quail is a potentially important avian model for molecular studies; a major drawback is the inability to sex visually before 3 weeks of age. Molecular sexing is therefore an absolute requirement when animals are sampled before that age.2. A low-cost method using common laboratory equipment based on Allele-Specific Multiplex-Polymerase Chain Reaction was developed to undertake reliable molecular identification of the sex of Coturnix japonica directly at hatching.3. This simple method works with down feathers collected from behind the neck of the newly hatched quail and includes internal controls during the PCR to limit risks of error. Males and females can be discriminated on the basis of the presence of one or two amplicons, respectively."

We describe a case of 46XY ambiguous genitalia that was misdiagnosed as androgen insensitivity syndrome. The correct diagnosis was made after adrenarche. Genotyping demonstrated compound heterozygosity in two alleles, the previously described c.244G >A (p.Ala82Thr), and a novel 931C >.T(p. Gln311*) variant. We suggest that adrenarche unmasked the condition by driving cortisol production to rates that caused the mutant 3bHSD2 enzyme to become rate limiting for cortisol production. This case illustrates how markedly different the effects of this condition may be on androgen production compared with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production. It also demonstrates how current guidelines based on urinary steroids and cortisol sufficiency may not arrive at the correct diagnosis, and underlines the importance of gene testing in the work-up of disorders of sexual differentiation."
90,biochemistry , Molecular biology  , 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase; Traumatic brain injury; Autophagic cell death; Mice        ,"3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) was a novel hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-synthesizing enzyme that may be involved in cyanide degradation and in thiosulfate biosynthesis. Over recent years, considerable attention has been focused on the biochemistry and molecular biology of H2S-synthesizing enzyme. In contrast, there have been few concerted attempts to investigate the changes in the expression of the H2S-synthesizing enzymes with disease states. To investigate the changes of 3-MST after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its possible role, mice TBI model was established by controlled cortical impact system, and the expression and cellular localization of 3-MST after TBI was investigated in the present study. Western blot analysis revealed that 3-MST was present in normal mice brain cortex. It gradually increased, reached a peak on the first day after TBI, and then reached a valley on the third day. Importantly, 3-MST was colocalized with neuron. In addition, Western blot detection showed that the first day post injury was also the autophagic peak indicated by the elevated expression of LC3. Importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that injury-induced expression of 3-MST was partly colabeled by LC3. However, there was no colocalization of 3-MST with propidium iodide (cell death marker) and LC3 positive cells were partly colocalized with propidium iodide. These data suggested that 3-MST was mainly located in living neurons and may be implicated in the autophagy of neuron and involved in the pathophysiology of brain after TBI."

Stochastic modeling is a new step in large data analysis that serves extracting cell biology concepts. We review here Smoluchowski's approach to stochastic processes and provide several applications for coarse-graining diffusion, studying polymer models for understanding nuclear organization and finally, we discuss the stochastic jump dynamics of telomeres across cell division and stochastic gene regulation."
77,biochemistry , Cell biology  , acidosis; cancer; epigenetics; hypoxia; metabolism; 2-hydroxyglutarate        ,"2-Hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) is an important epigenetic regulator, with potential roles in cancer and stem cell biology. The d-(R)-enantiomer (d-2-HG) is an oncometabolite generated from -ketoglutarate (-KG) by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase, whereas l-(S)-2-HG is generated by lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in response to hypoxia. Because acidic pH is a common feature of hypoxia, as well as tumor and stem cell microenvironments, we hypothesized that pH may regulate cellular 2-HG levels. Herein we report that cytosolic acidification under normoxia moderately elevated 2-HG in cells, and boosting endogenous substrate -KG levels further stimulated this elevation. Studies with isolated lactate dehydrogenase-1 and malate dehydrogenase-2 revealed that generation of 2-HG by both enzymes was stimulated severalfold at acidic pH, relative to normal physiologic pH. In addition, acidic pH was found to inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial l-2-HG removal enzyme l-2-HG dehydrogenase and to stimulate the reverse reaction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (carboxylation of -KG to isocitrate). Furthermore, because acidic pH is known to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and 2-HG is a known inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, we hypothesized that 2-HG may be required for acid-induced HIF stabilization. Accordingly, cells stably overexpressing l-2-HG dehydrogenase exhibited a blunted HIF response to acid. Together, these results suggest that acidosis is an important and previously overlooked regulator of 2-HG accumulation and other oncometabolic events, with implications for HIF signaling."

Various approaches have been utilised including fusion of protein transduction domains with a protein or biomolecule of interest. A compounding issue is lack of specificity, efficiency and indeed whether the protein fusions are actually translocated into the cell and not merely an artefact of the fixation process. Here we present a novel platform, allowing the inducible export and uptake of a protein of interest. The system utilises a combination of the Tetracyline repressor system, combined with a fusion protein containing the N-terminal signal peptide from human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit, and a C-terminal poly-arginine domain for efficient uptake by target cells. This novel platform was validated using enhanced green fluorescent protein as the gene of interest. Doxycycline efficiently induced expression of the fusion protein. The human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit facilitated the export of the fusion protein into the cell culture media. Finally, the fusion protein was able to efficiently enter into neighbouring cells (target cells), mediated by the poly-arginine cell penetrating peptide. Importantly we have addressed the issue of whether the observed uptake is an artefact of the fixation process or indeed genuine translocation. In addition this platform provides a number of potential applications in diverse areas such as stem cell biology, immune therapy and cancer targeting therapies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Mass spectrometry based proteomics is one of the most promising approaches for identifying thousands of phosphorylation events in a single experiment, yet the full breadth of the phosphoproteome has yet to be elucidated. In this article, we examined the complementarity of two methods for phosphopeptide enrichment based on either titanium dioxide (TiO2) enrichment or phosphorylation motif-specific immunoaffinity precipitation (IAP) with four different antibodies. Each method identified nearly 2000 phosphoproteins. However, distinct populations of phosphopeptides were observed. Despite quantifying over 10 000 unique phosphorylation events using TiO2 and over 3900 with IAP, less than 5% of the sites were in common. Agreeing with published literature, the ratio of pS:pT:pY phosphorylation for the TiO2-enriched data set approximated 90:10:< 1. In contrast, that ratio for the combined IAP data, sets was 51:29:20. These differences not only suggest the complementarity between multiple enrichment methods but also emphasize their collective importance in obtaining a comprehensive view of the phosphoproteome."

Despite the fall in diagnoses and mortality, the reported incidence of metastatic disease has increased 72% since 2004. Prostate cancer arises in cohesive groups as intraepithelial neoplasia, migrates through muscle and leaves the gland via perineural invasion for hematogenous dissemination. Current technological advances have shown cohesive-clusters of tumor (also known as microemboli) within the circulation. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) profiles are indicative of disseminated prostate cancer, and disseminated tumor cells (DTC) are found in cohesive-clusters, a phenotypic characteristic of both radiation- and drug-resistant tumors. Recent reports in cell biology and informatics, coupled with mass spectrometry, indicate that the integrin adhesome network provides an explanation for the biophysical ability of cohesive-clusters of tumor cells to invade thorough muscle and nerve microenvironments while maintaining adhesion-dependent therapeutic resistance. Targeting cohesive-clusters takes advantage of the known ability of extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion to promote tumor cell survival and represents an approach that has the potential to avoid the progression to drug- and radiotherapy-resistance. In the following review we will examine the evidence for development and dissemination of cohesive-clusters in metastatic prostate cancer. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V."

The retention of both tracers was studied by body radioactivity measurement. Levels in blood and excreta were determined by gamma-ray spectrometry and/or accelerator mass spectrometry. 2 More than half of the Al-26 had left the blood after 15 min and the decline continued, leaving <1% in blood after 2 d; the losses occurred both to renal excretion and through uptake by other compartments. Estimated excretion up to 13 d was 83% (urine) and 1.8% (faeces). Whole-body retention of 15% at 13 d declined to similar to 4% at 1178 d, when the daily reduction corresponded to a biological half-life of 7 y, suggesting that sustained intake of dietary aluminium may lead to a progressively increasing internal deposit. 3 The metabolism of Ga-67 differed markedly from that of Al-26 in all aspects studied."

A model that predicts human metabolism and disposition of drug candidates would be of value in early drug development. 2. In this study, a chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID mouse model was evaluated with three structurally distinct compounds (GW695634, a benzophenone, SB-406725, a tetrahydroisoquinoline and GW823093, a fluoropyrrolidine) for which human metabolism and disposition was characterized. Human metabolite profiles in plasma and/or urine were compared to those of chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID and control CD-1 or (uPA+/+)/SCID) mice. GW695634 and SB-406725 exhibited primarily hepatic metabolism and were chosen as probes to assess which human metabolites would likely circulate systemically. GW823093 exhibited a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism such that renal excretion of drug-related material was similar to 2-fold greater in humans than in mice, and thus chosen as a probe to assess if the chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID mouse would predict the urinary excretion of human metabolites. 3. We observed that human metabolism and disposition was well represented for GW695634, somewhat represented for GW823093 and minimally represented for SB-406725. Collectively, the results of this and other studies suggest that while limitations for prediction of human metabolism and disposition exist, humanized chimeric mouse models can potentially represent informative new tools in drug discovery and development."

A novel oral chymase inhibitor, SUN13834, is under clinical development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). In this study, in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles of SUN13834 were compared between severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, chimeric mice with humanized liver and humans. 2. In in vitro experiments using liver microsomes, predominant metabolites of SUN13834 were glucuronide (MG-1) in SCID mice and hydroxylated metabolite (M-3) in chimeric mice and humans. 3. After a single oral dose of [C-14]SUN13834 to SCID and chimeric mice, glucuronidation was the major metabolic pathway in SCID mice, while the parent compound, ring opening form (M-5), O-demethylated form of M-5 (M-6) and glucuronidation of M-6 (M-6G) were detected at higher levels in chimeric mice compared to SCID mice. 4. When AD patients were orally treated using SUN13834 for 28 days, the parent compound had the highest concentration in plasma, and M-6, M-6G, M-5 and MG-1 were identified as major metabolites. 5. This is the first report of SUN13834 metabolic information in human. In addition, based on similarities in metabolic profiles between chimeric mice and humans, it was concluded that chimeric mice are useful for predicting SUN13834 metabolism in humans during early stages of drug development."

Human chimeric mice (h-PXB mice) having humanized liver, constructed by transplantation of human hepatocytes, were evaluated as an experimental model for predicting human drug metabolism. Metabolism of zaleplon in h-PXB mice was compared with that in rat chimeric mice (r-PXB mice) constructed by transplantation of rat hepatocytes. 2. Zaleplon is metabolized to 5-oxo-zaleplon by aldehyde oxidase and to desethyl-zaleplon by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) in rat and human liver preparations. 3. Liver S9 fraction of h-PXB mice metabolized zaleplon to 5-oxo-zaleplon and desethylzaleplon in similar amounts. However, liver S9 fractions of r-PXB and control (urokinase-type plasminogen activator-transgenic severe combined immunodeficient) mice predominantly metabolized zaleplon to desethyl-zaleplon. 5-Oxo-zaleplon was detected as a minor metabolite. 4. Oxidase activity of h-PXB mouse liver cytosol toward zaleplon was about 10-fold higher than that of r-PXB or control mice. In contrast, activities for desethyl-zaleplon formation were similar in liver microsomes from these mice, as well as rat and human liver microsomes. 5. In vivo, the level of 5-oxo-zaleplon in plasma of h-PXB mice was about 7-fold higher than that in r-PXB or control mice, in agreement with the in vitro data. Thus, aldehyde oxidase in h-PXB mice functions as human aldehyde oxidase, both in vivo and in vitro. 6. In contrast, the plasma level of desethyl-zaleplon in r-PXB and control mice was higher than that in h-PXB mice. 7. These results suggest h-PXB mice with humanized liver could be a useful experimental model to predict aldehyde oxidase-and CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism in humans."

Human-chimeric mice with humanized liver have been constructed by transplantation of human hepatocytes into several types of mice having genetic modifications that injure endogenous liver cells. Here, we focus on liver urokinase-type plasminogen activator-transgenic severe combined immunodeficiency (uPA/SCID) mice, which are the most widely used human-chimeric mice. Studies so far indicate that drug metabolism, drug transport, pharmacological effects and toxicological action in these mice are broadly similar to those in humans. 2. Expression of various drug-metabolizing enzymes is known to be different between humans and rodents. However, the expression pattern of cytochrome P450, aldehyde oxidase and phase II enzymes in the liver of human-chimeric mice resembles that in humans, not that in the host mice. 3. Metabolism of various drugs, including S-warfarin, zaleplon, ibuprofen, naproxen, coumarin, troglitazone and midazolam, in human-chimeric mice is mediated by human drug-metabolizing enzymes, not by host mouse enzymes, and thus resembles that in humans. 4. Pharmacological and toxicological effects of various drugs in human-chimeric mice are also similar to those in humans. 5.

Host-parasitoid systems are characterized by a continuous development of new defence strategies in hosts and counter-defence mechanisms in parasitoids. This co-evolutionary arms race makes host-parasitoid systems excellent for understanding trade-offs in host use caused by evolutionary changes in host immune responses and parasitoid virulence. However, knowledge obtained from natural host-parasitoid systems on such trade-offs is still limited. 2. In this study, the aim was to examine trade-offs in parasitoid virulence in Asecodes parviclava (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) when attacking three closely related beetles: Galerucella pusilla, Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella tenella (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). A second aim was to examine whether geographic variation in parasitoid infectivity or host immune response could explain differences in parasitism rate between northern and southern sites. 3. More specifically, we wanted to examine whether the capacity to infect host larvae differed depending on the previous host species of the parasitoids and if such differences were connected to differences in the induction of host immune systems. This was achieved by combining controlled parasitism experiments with cytological studies of infected larvae. 4. Our results reveal that parasitism success in A. parviclava differs both depending on previous and current host species, with a higher virulence when attacking larvae of the same species as the previous host. Virulence was in general high for parasitoids from G. pusilla and low for parasitoids from G. calmariensis. At the same time, G. pusilla larvae had the strongest immune response and G. calmariensis the weakest. These observations were linked to changes in the larval hemocyte composition, showing changes in cell types important for the encapsulation process in individuals infected by more or less virulent parasitoids. 5. These findings suggest ongoing evolution in parasitoid virulence and host immune response, making the system a strong candidate for further studies on host race formation and speciation."

However, little is known about the immunomodulatory effects of this protein on host cell. In the present study gene encoding 24kDa excretory/secretory protein (HcES-24) was cloned. The recombinant protein of HcES-24 (rHcES-24) was expressed in a histidine-tagged fusion protein soluble form in Escherichia coli. Binding activity of rHcES-24 to goat PBMCs was confirmed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and its immunomudulatory effect on cytokine secretion, cell proliferation, cell migration and nitric oxide production were observed by co-incubation of rHcES-24. IFA results revealed that rHcES-24 could bind to the PBMCs. The interaction of rHcES-24 increased the production of IL4, IL10, IL17 and cell migration in dose dependent manner. However, rHcES-24 treatment significantly suppressed the production of IFN gamma, proliferation of the PBMC and Nitric oxide (NO) production. Our findings showed that the rHcES-24 played important regulatory effects on the goat PBMCs."

Fish (14.6 +/- 2.3 g) were fed three experimental diets prepared by supplementing a basal diet with L. plantarum at different concentrations [1 x 10(7), 1 x 10(8) and 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfu) g(-1)] and a control (non-supplemented basal) diet for 8 weeks. Innate immune responses (immunoglobulin (Ig), alternative complement activity (ACH50) and lysozyme activity) were significantly higher in fish fed the 1 x 10(8) and 1 x 10(9) cfu g(-1) L. plantarum diet compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, fish fed on various levels of L. plantarum significantly showed higher red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell (WBC) and monocyte compared to those of the control group (P < 0.05). At the end of the feeding experiment, some fish were challenged with S. iniae to quantify the level of disease resistance. The mortality after S. iniae challenge was decreased in fish fed a probiotic. These results indicated that dietary supplementation of L. plantarum improved immune response and disease resistance of Siberian sturgeon juvenile."

The use of inbred mouse strains enabled controlled studies of immune cell and molecule functions in defined settings. These studies were usually performed in specific-pathogen free (SPF) environments providing standardized conditions. In contrast, mammalians including humans living in their natural habitat are continuously facing pathogen encounters throughout their life. The influences of environmental conditions on the signatures of the immune system and on experimental outcomes are yet not well defined. Thus, the transferability of results obtained in current experimental systems to the physiological human situation has always been a matter of debate. Studies elucidating the diversity of wild immunology imprintings in detail and comparing it with those of clean lab mice are sparse. Here, we applied multidimensional mass cytometry to dissect phenotypic and functional differences between distinct groups of laboratory and pet shop mice as a source for wild mice. For this purpose, we developed a 31-antibody panel for murine leukocyte subsets identification and a 35-antibody panel assessing various cytokines. Established murine leukocyte populations were easily identified and diverse immune signatures indicative of numerous pathogen encounters were classified particularly in pet shop mice and to a lesser extent in quarantine and non-SPF mice as compared to SPF mice. In addition, unsupervised analysis identified distinct clusters that associated strongly with the degree of pathogenic priming, including increased frequencies of activated NK cells and antigen-experienced B- and T-cell subsets. Our study unravels the complexity of immune signatures altered under physiological pathogen challenges and highlights the importance of carefully adapting laboratory settings for immunological studies in mice, including drug and therapy testing.

Individual plant genotypes as well as genotypic diversity can shape the structure and function of ecosystems; however, the abiotic environment may modify these genotypic influences on ecosystem-level responses. 2. To explore how the interactions between plant genotype, genotypic diversity and soil nutrient availability affect the structure and function of a temperate grassland ecosystem, we manipulated the genotypic diversity of a common perennial herbaceous plant, Solidago altissima (single genotype monoculture and diversity plots) and soil nutrient availability (+nitrogen, +phosphorus, +nitrogen and +phosphorus, unmanipulated control) in a common garden setting. We tracked temporal changes in ecosystem structure (e.g. leaf area index and net primary productivity) as well as a variety of ecosystem functions (e.g. net ecosystem carbon and water exchange and soil carbon efflux) over a growing season. 3. We found that variation in plant genotype identity consistently shaped ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) while it inconsistently altered several ecosystem functions across time. For instance, variation in plant genotype identity influenced net ecosystem carbon dynamics early in the growing season while it influenced water dynamics later in the growing season. The strength of the relationship between genotypic diversity and ecosystem function declined over the season and the relationship between ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) and function (net ecosystem carbon and water exchange) varied across treatments. Overall, there was a strong correlation between ecosystem structure and function across monoculture genotype plots but a weak relationship between ecosystem structure and function across mixed genotype plots. Surprisingly, soil nutrients did not influence ecosystem structure and had minimal impacts on carbon and water flux. 4. Our data suggest that plant genetic variation, and to some extent plant genotypic diversity, strongly influence ecosystem structure and function in an old-field ecosystem, but nutrient availability did not directly or interactively influence ecosystem structure or function."

Species coexistence requires differential response to inter-and intraspecific competition, typically conceptualized as niche differentiation. Coexistence of close relatives therefore poses an interesting scenario with regards to niche differentiation since these species generally have many traits in common due to shared ancestry. Native Californian Trifolium assemblages are locally diverse and represent a unique system for understanding competitive interactions among close relatives. 2. We conducted two similar greenhouse studies in which Trifolium fucatum was grown alone, with a con-specific competitor, and with a congeneric competitor (Trifolium macraei). In the first study, we assessed biomass production in T. fucatum, and in the second study we conducted an RNAseq analysis of T. fucatum roots to test for differentially expressed genes that may mediate competitive interactions and potentially coexistence. 3. Compared to plants grown alone, competition (i.e. growth in the same pot) with a conspecific resulted in a greater reduction in biomass than competition with a congener, as predicted by theory. However, competition with a congener resulted in twice as many differentially expressed genes as competition with a conspecific. 4. Annotations of identified genes differentiating congeneric from conspecific competition suggest several functions attributed to interactions with third-party organisms, including nodulation with rhizobial mutualists, and defence responses against pathogens and herbivores. In addition, salt-responsive genes and an iron transporter were differentially expressed in congeneric competition, and comparisons of sodium and iron concentrations in field soils where these species are found showed that T. fucatum occurs in higher sodium and iron microsites than T. macraei. Thus, the transcriptome highlighted abiotic niche axes worth pursuing in future ecological experiments as potential mediators of coexistence. 5. We also found a subset of genes that responded similarly to both congeneric and conspecific competition in both direction and magnitude, indicating some conserved responses to competition, regardless of neighbour identity. 6. Synthesis. Transcriptomic analyses represent novel tools for identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions among species. Working iteratively with ecological experimentation and observation, transcriptomes may allow us to identify novel dimensions of the n-dimensional niche that determine species' distributions and their ability to coexist."

Species diversity is declining more rapidly in freshwater ecosystems than in any other, but the consequences for genetic diversity, and hence evolutionary potential, are poorly understood. In part this reflects limited use and development of modern molecular tools and genetic approaches to address conservation questions in rivers, lakes and wetlands. As widespread, diverse and functionally important organisms, freshwater macroinvertebrates are ideal candidates for genetic approaches to reveal, for example, the conservation consequences of demographic histories and past disturbances. However, the availability of microsatellite markers for this group is very limited. 2. Using next generation sequencing, microsatellite markers were developed for Isoperla grammatica (Poda, 1761), Amphinemura sulcicollis (Stephens, 1836) and Baetis rhodani (Pictet, 1843) to enable conservation genetic investigations of these widespread invertebrate species. Fifty-two robust microsatellite loci were developed (18, 21 and 13 per species), all with high levels of allelic diversity (7-27, 3-16, 5-13 alleles per loci, respectively). 3. These tools will allow assessment of genetic structure, dispersal and demographic resilience in these model species as a function of environmental change and variation, thereby aiding freshwater monitoring and conservation. The authors urge further capacity building to support genetic applications to the conservation biology of other aquatic organisms. Copyright # 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

624,biochemistry , Genetics  , enzyme evolution; beta-lactamase; functional synthesis; drug-resistance evolution; sign epistasis; antagonistic pleiotropy        ,"A leading intellectual challenge in evolutionary genetics is to identify the specific phenotypes that drive adaptation. Enzymes offer a particularly promising opportunity to pursue this question, because many enzymes' contributions to organismal fitness depend on a comparatively small number of experimentally accessible properties. Moreover, on first principles the demands of enzyme thermostability stand in opposition to the demands of catalytic activity. This observation, coupled with the fact that enzymes are only marginally thermostable, motivates the widely held hypothesis that mutations conferring functional improvement require compensatory mutations to restore thermostability. Here, we explicitly test this hypothesis for the first time, using four missense mutations in TEM-1 beta-lactamase that jointly increase cefotaxime Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) similar to 1500-fold. First, we report enzymatic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M) and thermostability (T-m, and thence Delta G of folding) for all combinations of these mutations. Next, we fit a quantitative model that predicts MIC as a function of k(cat)/K-M and Delta G. While k(cat)/K-M explains similar to 54% of the variance in cefotaxime MIC (similar to 92% after log transformation), Delta G does not improve explanatory power of the model. We also find that cefotaxime MIC rises more slowly in k(cat)/K-M than predicted. Several explanations for these discrepancies are suggested. Finally, we demonstrate substantial sign epistasis in MIC and k(cat)/K-M, and antagonistic pleiotropy between phenotypes, in spite of near numerical additivity in the system. Thus constraints on selectively accessible trajectories, as well as limitations in our ability to explain such constraints in terms of underlying mechanisms are observed in a comparatively ""well-behaved"" system."

Background: A key feature of factorIXa is its allosteric transformation from an enzymatically latent form into a potent procoagulant. Although several small molecules have been found to be capable of partially affecting FIXa function (i.e. ethylene glycol, Ca2+, and low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]), the resulting modest changes in peptidolytic activity have made the study of their mechanisms of action challenging. As these effects provide hints about potential regulatory forces that may be operational in the full expression of FIXa coagulant activity, their description remains of great interest. Studies of crystal structures have yielded insights into the structural changes induced by these effectors, but there remains a paucity of information to correlate any given structural change with specific consequences for FIXa function.Objectives: To correlate structural changes induced by these modulators with defined consequences for FIXa substrate discrimination and function.Methods: A peptidomics-based mass spectrometry (MS) approach was used to examine the patterns of hydrolysis of four combinatorial chemistry-derived pentapeptide libraries by FIXa under various conditions in a soluble, active enzyme system.Results: Ethylene glycol specifically altered the S3 subsite of FIXa to render it more tolerant to side chains at the P3 substrate position, whereas Ca2+ enhanced tolerance at the S2 subsite. In contrast, LMWH altered both the S2 and S1' subsites.Conclusions: These results demonstrate the role of plasticity in regulating FIXa function with respect to discrimination of extended substrate sequences, as well as providing crucial insights into active site modulations that may be capitalized on by various physiologic cofactors of FIXa and in future drug design."

In this method, MV+ is rapidly formed photochemically by pulsed laser excitation and the intermolecular ET and active site dynamics are followed by nanosecond time-resolved visible and infrared spectroscopy, respectively.

Cyadox is a novel quinoxaline-1,4-dioxide with the potential for development as a substitute for the banned veterinary drugs carbadox and olaquindox. In this paper, using pigs as the test subjects, the metabolic mechanism of cyadox N-oxide reduction in liver is demonstrated. 2. There exist two metabolic mechanisms for the N-oxide reduction of cyadox, the enzymatic and non-enzymatic routes. It is found that cyadox can be enzymatically reduced to 4-cyadox monoxide and 1-cyadox monoxide; this process is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase in the cytosol and by cytochrome b5 reductase in the microsomes. On the other hand, cyadox is only reduced to 4-cyadox monoxide in the non-enzymatic reduction mediated by heme groups of catalase and cytochrome P450s. 3. We supposed that, owing to the position of the side chain in cyadox, the 1-N-oxide and 4-N-oxide bonds in the quinoxaline ring had different biochemical activities, which caused cyadox to be shunted to the distinct metabolic mechanisms. Additionally, this research gives the first evidence of FAD- and NAD(P)H-dependent non-enzymatic catalase reduction of a heterocyclic N-oxide. The research provides a basic foundation for the formulation of safety controls for animal products and the properties and metabolism of heterocyclic N-oxides."

Recent in vitro experiments suggested that human 11 beta-HSD1 metabolizes the secondary bile acid 7-oxolithocholic acid (7-oxoLCA) to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Here, we provide evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies for a major role of 11 beta-HSD1 in the oxidoreduction of 7-oxoLCA and compare its level and metabolism in several species. Hepatic microsomes from liver-specific 11 beta-HSD1-deficient mice were devoid of 7-oxoLCA oxidoreductase activity. Importantly, circulating and intrahepatic levels of 7-oxoLCA and its taurine conjugate were significantly elevated in mouse models of 11 beta-HSD1 deficiency. Moreover, comparative enzymology of 11 beta-HSD1-dependent oxidoreduction of 7-oxoLCA revealed that the guinea-pig enzyme is devoid of 7-oxoLCA oxidoreductase activity. Unlike in other species, 7-oxoLCA and its glycine conjugate are major bile acids in guinea-pigs.(jlr) In conclusion, the oxidoreduction of 7-oxoLCA and its conjugated metabolites are catalyzed by 11 beta-HSD1, and the lack of this activity leads to the accumulation of these bile acids in guinea-pigs and 11 beta-HSD1-deficient mice. Thus, 7-oxoLCA and its conjugates may serve as biomarkers of impaired 11 beta-HSD1 activity."

Most LOXs constitute single polypeptide chain proteins that fold into a two-domain structure. In the crystal structure the two domains are tightly associated, but small angle X-ray scattering data and dynamic fluorescence studies suggested a high degree of structural flexibility involving movement of the N-terminal domain relative to catalytic subunit. When we inspected the interdomain interface we have found a limited number of side-chain contacts which are involved in interactions of these two structural subunits. One of such contact points involves tyrosine 98 of N-terminal domain. This aromatic amino acid is invariant in vertebrate LOXs regardless of overall sequence identity. To explore in more detail the role of aromatic interactions in interdomain association we have mutated Y98 to various residues and quantified the structural and functional consequences of these alterations. We have found that loss of an aromatic moiety at position 98 impaired the catalytic activity and membrane binding capacity of the mutant enzymes. Although CD and fluorescence emission spectra of wild-type and mutant enzyme species were indistinguishable, the mutation led to enlargement of the molecular shape of the enzyme as detected by analytic gel filtration and this structural alteration was shown to be associated with a loss of protein thermal stability. The possible role of tight interdomain association for the enzyme's structural performance is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, few reports have demonstrated an association between these agents and cholangiocarcinoma in rodent carcinogenicity studies. Moreover, the combined effects of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo mutagenicity of 1,2-DCP and DCM, alone or combined, in the livers of gpt delta rats. Six-week-old male F344 gpt delta rats were treated with 1,2-DCP, DCM or 1,2-DCP+DCM by oral administration for 4weeks at the dose (200mgkg(-1) body weight 1,2-DCP and 500mgkg(-1) body weight DCM) used in the carcinogenesis study performed by the National Toxicology Program. In vivo mutagenicity was analyzed by gpt mutation/Spi(-) assays in the livers of rats. In addition, gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1, the major enzymes responsible for the genotoxic effects of 1,2-DCP and DCM, were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Gpt and Spi(-) mutation frequencies were not increased by 1,2-DCP and/or DCM in any group. Additionally, there were no significant changes in the gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1 in any group. These results indicated that 1,2-DCP, DCM and 1,2-DCP+DCM had no significant impact on mutagenicity in the livers of gpt delta rats under our experimental conditions.

Several eel species have undergone extensive declines at both local and global level. The aim of this study was to identify the reasons for the collapse of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock in an important area for biodiversity conservation (Comacchio Lagoon, Italy), in order to support the development of eel conservation plans. 2. The records of silver eel catches from Comacchio describe the total migratory population and cover the period 1781- 2013. The data are accompanied by information related to habitat loss and other local factors. The role of local factors on the decline of the local stock was investigated, while additional information from the literature was also used to discuss the effects of global factors (including glass eel harvest for aquaculture, climateoceanographic changes, habitat loss, pollution and parasitism) on the three eel species A. anguilla, Anguilla japonica and Anguilla rostrata. 3. The records from Comacchio provided significant information about the effects of local factors on the local eel populations in the past. However, the current population collapse, which started in the 1970s, could not be explained by local factors. 4. The literature on global factors suggests that the three eel species are under combined threat from various factors. The correlations between European aquaculture production data compared with the Comacchio yields and published data from other European eel and glass eel fisheries were found to be highly significant. Aquaculture, which depends entirely on wild- caught glass eels, seems to play a key role in the decline of natural stocks. 5. Conservative estimates using FAO data showed that the current numbers of glass eels needed to support aquaculture production in Europe and Asia exceeds 2 x 109 specimens. This requirement, largely supplied by A. anguilla glass eels, can explain the decline of eel populations since the glass eel trade has been expanded at an international level.

Low-level light therapy (LLLT) exhibits positive effects on rehabiliation of degenerative nerves and neural disorders. With this in mind, we postulate that 3D printed neural scaffold coupling with LLLT will generate a new strategy to repair neural degeneration. To achieve this goal, we applied red laser light to stimualte neural stem cells on 3D printed scaffolds and investigated the subsequent cell response with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that cell prolifeartion rate and intracellular reactive oxgen species synthesis were significantly increased after 15 s laser stimulation follwed by 1 d culture. Over culturing time of 14 d in vitro, the laser stimulation promoted neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells, while the glial differentiation was suppressed based on results of both immunocytochemistry studies and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. These findings suggest that integration of 3D printing and LLLT might provide a powerful methodology for neural tissue engineering."

They act as amplification probes which aggregate numerous gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on test line by forming a threedimensional DNA-AuNPs network structure in the presence of target. Sensitive detection of nucleic acid with point-of-care analysis is significant for infectious agent, early diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. The use of these particles in rapid ultrasensitive point of care (POC) lateral flow assays lead to a linear range from 0.1 pM to 250 nM with a limit of detection of 0.01 pM without polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The proposed method could increase the sensitivity by 4 orders of magnitudes than traditional sandwich assays labeled with AuNPs. Furthermore, the assay owns good reproducibility and stability, which will prove practical diagnostic applications."

Eighteen genomic fingerprinting (GF) genotypes were obtained from the combined results of BOX-, REP-, and GTG(5)-PCR, indicating that the PSS population in Japan has high genetic diversity. The result based on logistic regression indicated that the population of GF genotype A was significantly related to a seed-producing district and that the epidemic of PSS strains in fields originated mainly from seed infection. This study will be applicable to future studies of the molecular epidemiology of bacterial plant diseases that have multiple infection routes."

[Methods] Rats were administrated with high-fat diet to produce NAFLD animal model and intervened by cordyceps sinensis. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) in liver were measured by biochemistry, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by luciferin-luciferinase, and UCP2 expression by Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry. Liver histopathology was evaluated. [Results] High-fat diet fed rats developed obesity and showed a gradual increase in body weight, liver index, and a decrease in ATP level. More advanced liver disease was found histopathologically for longer high-fat diet. Up-regulation of liver UCP2 by high-fat diet stopped after week 12. However codyceps sinensis induced UCP2 up-regulation continuously, and kept liver ATP a relatively high level. [Conclusion] NAFLD rat models were produced successfully. Liver UCP2 up-regulation in NAFLD rats may be a definite beneficial adaptation to lipid exposure. Cordyceps sinensis may serve a protective role to prevent NAFLD from progression. One of the possible mechanisms involves in modulating UCP2 expression and thereby, regulating fat metabolism, energy homeostasis."

Angiotensin (Ang) II plays a major role in vascular remodelling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are involved in the tissue remodelling processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AngII modulates TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo. 2. Angiotensin II (200 ng/kg per min, s.c.) or AngII + losartan (10 mg/kg per day, s.c.) or normal saline was administered continuously by osmotic minipumps to Sprague-Dawley rats for 1 week. In addition, the effect of endogenous AngII on TIMP-2 expression was evaluated in renovascular hypertensive rats (two kidney, one clip (2K1C) and one kidney, one clip (1K1C) models). Control rats (sham 2K1C and sham 1K1C rats) underwent sham-clipping of the left renal artery. At the end of the treatment, plasma renin activity was measured by radioimmunoassay, aortic TIMP-2 mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or northern blotting and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured twice a week by the tail-cuff method. 3. Exogenous AngII administration produced the expected increase in SBP (P = 0.02) compared with the control saline-treated group. The increase in SBP was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. Administration of AngII caused a significant increase in TIMP-2 expression (P = 0.01) in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. In renovascular hypertensive rats, SBP was higher (P < 0.0001) in 2K1C and 1K1C rats compared with the corresponding sham-operated rats. Plasma renin activity was higher (P < 0.01) in 2K1C rats compared with the other groups. The expression of TIMP-2 was significantly (P < 0.05) increased only in 2K1C rats. 4. Our in vivo data demonstrate that exogenous and endogenous AngII increases TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. This effect is not dependent on the AngII-induced increase in blood pressure and is mediated by angiotensin AT(1) receptors."
36,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter; cloning; digoxin intoxication; mouse; mRNA        ,"1. Human ABCA8, a new member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, transports certain lipophilic drugs, such as digoxin. To investigate the roles of this transporter, we cloned a mouse homologue of ABCA8, from a mouse heart cDNA library, named ABCA8a. 2. The deduced mouse ABCA8a protein is 66% identical with that of human ABCA8 and possesses features common to the ABC superfamily. It was found that ABCA8a was mainly expressed in the liver and heart, similar to human ABCA8. 3. We further evaluated the effect of acute digoxin (a substrate for ABCA8) intoxication on the mRNA expression of ABCA8 using northern blotting with a 3' non-coding region as a probe to avoid cross-hybridization with other ABCA genes. 4. Following acute digoxin infusion, the mRNA expression of ABCA8 was significantly reduced in the liver 12-24 h after injection (14.7% of vehicle treatment), but not in the heart and kidney. 5. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the reduction in ABCA8a mRNA. Similar reductions in ABCA5, ABCA7, ABCA8b and ABCA9 mRNA were also observed. A comparable amount of digitoxin did not affect ABCA8a mRNA expression in the liver. 6. The results suggest that ABCA8 may play a role in digoxin metabolism in the liver."
69,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , 1A6/DRIM; UTP20; 18S rRNA processing; U3 snoRNA        ,"1A6/DRIM is a nucleolar protein with a nucleolar targeting sequence in its 3'-terminus. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that human 1A6/ DRIM shares 23% identity and 43% similarity with yeast Utp20, which has been reported as a component of U3 snoRNA protein complex and has been implicated in 18S rRNA processing. In the present study, we found, by utilizing RT-PCR with RNA extracted from anti-1A6/DRIM inummoprecipitates and Northern blotting, that 1A6/DRIM is associated with U3 snoRNA. Pulse-chase labeling assays showed that silencing of 1A6/DRIM expression in HeLa cells resulted in a delayed 18S rRNA processing. Furthermore, immunoprecipitations revealed that 1A6/DRIM was also associated with fibrillarin, another U3 RNP component in HeLa cells. These results indicate that 1A6/DRIM is involved in 18S rRNA processing and is the bona fide mammalian Utp20. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
91,biochemistry , Northern blotting  , cDNA cloning; 4-coumarate; coenzyme A ligase (4CL); Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza); enzymatic kinetic assays; water-soluble phenolic acids        ,"4-Coumarate: coenzyme A ligase (4CL) is one of the key enzymes in phenylpropanoid metabolism leading to series of phenolics, including water-soluble phenolic acids, which are important compounds determining the medicinal quality of Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb. To investigate the function of 4CL in the biosynthesis of water-soluble phenolic acid in Danshen, we have cloned two cDNAs (Sm4CL1 and Sm4CL2) encoding divergent 4CL members by applying nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers followed by 5'/3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (Note, these sequence data have been submitted to the GenBank database under accession numbers AY237163 and AY237164). Either of the coding regions was inserted into a pRSET vector and a kinetic assay was performed with purified recombinant proteins. The substrate utilization profile of Sm4CL1 was distinct from that of Sm4CL2. The K(m) values of Sm4CL1 and Sm4CL2 to 4-coumaric acid were (72.20 +/- 4.10) and (6.50 +/- 1.45) mu mol/L, respectively. These results, in conjunction with Northern blotting and other information, imply that Sm4CL2 may play an important role in the biosynthesis of water-soluble phenolic compounds, whereas Sm4CL1 may play a minor role in the pathway. Southern blotting analysis suggested that both Sm4CL1 and Sm4CL2 genes are present as a single copy and are located at different sites in the genome."
12,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , bioinformatics approaches; causal missense mutation; gene F8; genetic counselling; haemophilia A; HAMSTeRS database        ,". Haemophilia A (HA) is caused by widespread mutations in the factor VIII gene. The high spontaneous mutation rate of this gene means that roughly 40% of HA mutations are private. This study aimed to describe the approaches used to confirm private disease-causing mutations in a cohort of Belgian HA patients. We studied 148 unrelated HA families for the presence of intron 22 and intron 1 inversion by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was used to detect large genomic rearrangements. Detection of point mutations was performed by DNA sequencing. Predicting the causal impact of new non-synonymous changes was studied by two general strategies: (i) molecular approaches such as family cosegregation, evaluation of the implicated codon based on phylogenic separated species and absence of the mutation in the general Belgian population, and (ii) bioinformatics approaches to analyse the potential functional consequences of missense mutations. Among the 148 HA patients, in addition to common intron 22 and intron 1 inversions as well as large deletions or duplications, 67 different point mutations were identified, of which 42 had been reported in the HAMSTeRS database, and 25 were novel including 10 null variants for which RNA analyses confirmed the causal effect of mutations located in a splice site consensus and 15 missense mutations whose causality was demonstrated by molecular approaches and bioinformatics. This article reports several strategies to evaluate the deleterious consequences of unreported F8 substitutions in a large cohort of HA patients."
13,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , age-related macular degeneration; genetics; retina; telomere        ,". Purpose: To evaluate the association between telomere length and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Circulating leucocyte telomere length and the proportion of telomeres <5kb were analysed in blood DNA samples taken from 121 patients with exudative AMD (83%), large drusen (14%) or central geographic atrophy (3%). Controls consisted of 77 age-matched subjects without AMD. The AMD status was assessed by a masked analysis of fundus photographs or angiographs. Telomere length was measured by Southern blotting. Results: Mean (SD) telomere length was 7.76kb (0.68) in AMD patients and 7.83 (0.69) in controls (p=0.485). The corresponding proportions of telomeres <5kb were 10.60 (2.76) and 10.05 (2.64) (p=0.197). In this material, there was no correlation between telomere length and age, gender or smoking status. There were no differences between the major AMD risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CFH, HTRA1 or C3 genes, expect for somewhat longer telomeres in controls with the C3 risk SNP. There were no differences in telomere length between patients with drusen or exudative AMD. Conclusions: Telomere length is not associated with exudative AMD or high-risk drusen."
100,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; Eupatorium adenophorum; HHO; phenylalanine ammonia-lyase        ,"6-Hydroxy-5-isopropyl-3,8-dimethyl-4a,5,6,7,8,8a-hexahydronaphthalen-2(1H)-one (HHO) is an allelopathic substance that is related to allelochemical metabolism in Eupatorium adenophorum. In this study, the full-length complementary DNA of two phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) genes and a fragment of the cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (CA4H) gene from E.?adenophorum (Ea) were cloned. The expression of all three genes was increased by the HHO treatment, with varying sensitivity: EaPAL2 >EaPAL1 >EaCA4H. Southern blotting suggested that there is a third member of the PAL gene family in this species."
121,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , Infectious mononucleosis; Epstein-Barr virus; EBV-terminal repeat; CD8; Cytotoxic T cells        ,"A 22-year-old male was admitted for a sustained fever of 2 months, lymphadenopathy, and liver dysfunction. Anti-VCA-IgM antibody was positive, with elevated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA load in the peripheral blood. Liver biopsy revealed infiltration of CD8-positive and EBV-positive cells. Most peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were also positive for CD8, and showed detectable levels of EBV-DNA. Monoclonal proliferation of EBV-infected cells was detected in the PBMCs by Southern blotting for EBV-terminal repeat (EBV-TR). Although EBV-positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-T-LPD) was suspected, the symptoms spontaneously resolved within 12 months. Anti-VCA-IgM antibody and the clonal band of EBV-TR were negative 1 year after the onset, while anti-EBNA antibody was positive. The final diagnosis was thus confirmed as infectious mononucleosis (IM). Our results indicate that EBV-infected CD8-positive cells and clonal proliferation of EBV-infected cells may be temporally detected in IM. EBV-T-LPDs should be carefully excluded in such cases."
162,biochemistry , Southern blotting  , T cell/histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma; Pure red cell aplasia; Autoimmune hemolytic anemia; Anti-erythropoietin receptor antibody; Rituximab        ,"A 79-year-old female diagnosed with T cell/histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma in complete remission after six cycles of rituximab-combined chemotherapy developed severe anemia, reticulocytopenia, and bone marrow erythroid hypoplasia. She was diagnosed with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) accompanied by Coombs-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia evidenced by a lack of glycophorin-A-positive cells in the bone marrow, haptoglobin under the detection level, and a high titer of RBC-bound IgG. Anti-erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) antibody was detected in the serum, and oligoclonal alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cells were also detected in her peripheral blood by Southern blotting analysis. Parvovirus B19 DNA was not detected by PCR. Although the treatment with rituximab had limited efficacy (specifically, only for hemolysis), subsequent cyclosporine therapy led to prompt recovery of erythropoiesis with the disappearance of anti-EPOR antibody and oligoclonal T cells. This is the first case report of anti-EPOR antibody-associated PRCA in a patient with malignant lymphoma treated successfully with cyclosporine."
